  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Mr. Munn was part of a team that worked with [customer], but was not his primary relationship manager.  He met [customer] through his associate, registered rep. [third party].  After discussing [customer's] goal of supplementing his retirement income from other sources (including real estate), the team recommended use of a SunLife Variable annuity with a living benefit.  Additionally, the team recommended that the client leave additional funds available outside the annuity in the event of a liquidity need.  Given [customer's] goals and circumstances at the time of purchase, Mr. Munn, [third party] and their team determined that the product was a suitable investment.  The investment sub-accounts did not perform well and the client is now unhappy with investment performance.""
