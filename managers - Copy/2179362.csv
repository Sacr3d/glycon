  ""Broker Comment"" : ""\""My wife and I had accumulated a lot of personal debt over the past couple of years.  We had completed two international adoptions in the past 3 years which was a big part of it.  My wife came home 2 1/2 years ago from work to take care of our newly adopted son so we lost her income as well as our medical insurance that was provided.  Her annual income was about $22,000 and the insurance benefit was about $12,000/year.  In 2016 my income was down about half of what it had been in 2015 and down over 60% of what it was in 2014.  This past November I had emergency surgery that left us with about $15,000 of medical bills.  My business is still slow and we did not have the ability to meet all of our financial obligations which is why we had to seek protection in the bankruptcy court.\""""
