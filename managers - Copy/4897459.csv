  ""Allegations"" : ""The client submitted a written complaint and demand for compensation related to a 2018 account transfer from an unaffiliated firm to CFS. The client represented orally and in writing that the funds in the account were inherited. However, the funds were gifted which impacts the taxable consequences. The client alleged that the recommendation to liquidate resulted in unanticipated capital gains. CFS determined that the recommendation was suitable. It is unclear what tax information was discussed. As an accommodation, CFS offered the client $5,000 to resolve this matter. At this time, CFS is currently awaiting response by the client. ** CFS and the client executed a settlement agreement to compensate the client in the amount of $5,000. As of 6/1/2020, the matter was deemed resolved."",
