  ""Broker Comment"" : ""09/01/2006 I PURCHASED A HOME FROM NEUMANN BUILDERS.  UPON OBTAINING A MORTGAGE THE BUILDER WAS PAID, BUT DID NOT PAY ANY SUBCONTRACTOR.  THE SUBCONTRACTORS FILED LIENS AND AT THAT TIME THE BUILDER DECLARED BANKRUPTCY.  THIS LEFT ME BOTH OWING THE MORTGAGE AND THE LIENS.  AS THIS TOOK PLACE THERE BECAME MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE STRUCTURE.  I CONTACTED THE TITLE INSURANCE, BUT THEY DENIED THE POLICY.  AN ATTORNEY RECOMMENDED THE FILING TO PROTECT REMAINING ASSETS.  KENOSHA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS BEEN MADE AWARE AND HAS LOOKED INTO \""THEFT BY CONTRACTOR.\""  STATUS OF INVESTIGATION IS STILL PENDING, AS IS FBI INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THIS BUILDER DID THIS TO OTHERS IN 7 STATES.  THESE LOANS WERE ALSO SOLD INTO THE SECONDARY MARKET AS CMO WHICH MAY CONSTITUTE FRAUD ON THE BUILDERS BEHALF.  I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BUILDER OR ANY OTHER PART OF THIS EXCEPT TO BE THE UNFORTUNATE INDIVIDUAL THAT PURCHASED ONE OF THE HOMES.""
