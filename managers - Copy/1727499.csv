  ""Allegations"" : ""Customer opened Pershing brokerage IRA [ACCT #] and individual [ACCT #] account in November 2014 with our registered representative Kerry Cox. In July of 2016 customer started working with a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) at another broker dealer to transfer these accounts out to the contra firm.   Her account with our firm is titled middle and last name however she titled her accounts at the contra firm first, middle and last name. On August 8, 2016 Pershing rejected both the transfers requesting a letter indicating both names are \""One and the Same\"".  Pershing mailed these rejection letters to the contra firm. To this date Pershing has never received a \""One and the Same\"" letter and both accounts are still at Pershing. On March 13, 2017 Mr. Cox received a complaint letter from client alleging she has lost 33 1/3 percent of her original $70,000 funds in the first year Mr. Cox managed her accounts. However, between the two accounts our records show she originally invested approximately $63,000. In the letter client stated if Mr. Cox doesn't release the accounts within 10 days of the date of the complaint letter she is contacting the SEC and \""Better Business Bureau\"". Mr. Cox replied to client via letter explaining he does not get involved in the transfer out process. Mr. Cox provided client the rejection letters Pershing mailed to the contra firms as well as a \""One and the Same\"" letter. Also, in Mr. Cox requested client to contact her new CFP (registered rep) to help her complete the \""One and the Same\"" letter to send to Pershing. The client didn't take reps advice on this account, she was taking her advice from some other person."",
