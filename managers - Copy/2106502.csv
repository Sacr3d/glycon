BRICKEY WAS SEPARATELY NAMED AS A RELIEF DEFENDANT ONLY.  THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT PROCEEDS FROM THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME WERE TRANSFERRED BY THE DEFENDANTS TO THE RELIEF DEFENDANTS SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF LURING NEW VICTIMS TO INVEST IN THE SCHEME. THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT BECAUSE THE SCHEME WAS FRAUDULENT, THE BROKERAGE SERVICES PERFORMED BY THE RELIEF DEFENDANTS IN EXCHANGE FOR THESE PAYMENTS, WERE NEITHER LEGITIMATE, NOR DID THEY CONFER ANY BENEFITS ON THEIR CUSTOMERS; THEREFORE, THE RELIEF DEFENDANTS HAVE NO RIGHTFUL OWNERSHIP INTEREST THAT COULD JUSTIFY THEIR RETAINING POSSESSION OF THESE FUNDS. ON 02/16/09 A FEDERAL COURT IN TEXAS APPOINTED A RECEIVER FOR ALL THE ASSETS AND RECORDS OF STANDFORD INTL BK, LTD (SIB), STANDFORD GROUP A PARTY TO THIS LAWSUIT. THESE STANDFORD DEFENDANTS ARE ACCUSED OF OPERATING A PONZI-LIKE SCHEME WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF CD'S ISSUED BY SIB (SIB CD).THE LAWSUIT SEEKS DISGORGEMENT OF COMMISSIONS EARNED BY MR.
