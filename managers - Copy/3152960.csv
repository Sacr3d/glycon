  ""Broker Comment"" : ""[CUSTOMER] AND [CUSTOMER] HAD PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED FIXED ANNUITIES FROM ANOTHER KIS REP. IN NOV 2006 THE CLIENTS EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THEIR EXISTING BOND PORTFOLIO AT ANOTHER FIRM, AND WERE REFERRED TO ME. WE WENT OVER OPTIONS BASED ON GETTING CONSISTENT INCOME ALONG WITH SOME FLEXIBILITY AND PRINCIPAL STABILITY WHEN THEY NEEDED THE MONEY. THEY WERE CONCERNED WITH [CUSTOMER]'S HEALTH SO THE NURSING CARE WAIVER AND DEATH BENEFIT AVAILABLE THROUGH ANNUITY PRODUCTS WAS QUITE ATTRACTIVE TO THEM. THEY LIKED THE FACT THAT THE VARIABLE ANNUITY WOULD GIVE THEM CONSISTENT INCOME AND THAT THEIR DEATH BENEFIT ESSENTIALLY GAVE THEM THE GREATER OF THE MARKET VALUE OR PRINCIPAL LESS WITHDRAWALS. WITH REGARD TO THE FIXED ANNUITY, THEY LIKED THE FACT THAT IT HAD NO MARKET VOLATILITY, 15% ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL PRIVILEGES WITHOUT PENALTY, AND THE NURSING HOME WAIVER AS WELL AS THE DEATH BENEFIT. TO MAKE SURE THE CLIENT UNDERSTOOD THE TRANSACTION, MY MANAGER CALLED TO VERIFY THAT THE CLIENT UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCTS.AFTER THE PHONE CALL, HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THEY FULLY UNDERSTOOD THEIR INVESTMENT DECISION.""
