  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I was arrested for bringing edible marijuana gummies across the border from Colorado to Texas.  I was a resident of Colorado for over 10 years and had a medical marijuana card.  I was prescribed this medication for insomnia and migraines, and it was purchased legally in the state of Colorado.  Because it is not legal in Texas, I was arrested and charged with the highest degree of felony.  I accepted a plea deal of guilty for deferred adjudication with community supervision in lieu of a conviction.  Once my probation is complete, the charges are effectively dismissed at the state level.""
