  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Mr. Kulczycki was on a skiing trip to Vail, Colorado with friends.  After a night out, Mr. Kulczycki entered what he thought was the place they were staying.  However, it was the wrong residence. Mr. Kulczycki was unaware of this until he was informed by the police.  Based on their investigation, the police determined nothing was taken from the residence or car.  All the charges, except for the criminal mischief charge, which is a misdemeanor, were dismissed by the District Attorney.  The criminal mischief charge was not dismissed due to damage to the property's door.  Mr. Kulczycki was granted early probation termination and completion of  community service.""
