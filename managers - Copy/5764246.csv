  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I was stuck with a lot of unsecured debt after my divorce in 2012 to the point where I didn't think I could ever pay it all back. I needed a fresh start and bankruptcy seemed to be the first step towards that. I filed in 2013 and it was discharged in 2013. I got the exact filing and discharge dates from my paperwork.""
