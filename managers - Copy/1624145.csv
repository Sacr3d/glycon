  ""Allegations"" : ""VIOLATIONS OF INTERNAL EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN LATE 2004, THE NASD REQUESTED CERTAIN MEMBER FIRMS TO CONDUCT INTERNAL AUDITS OF THEIR SALES AND MARKETING GROUPS' TRAVEL & ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSE REPORTS/ACTIVITIES.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT I HAD VIOLATED THE FIRM'S INTERNAL EXPENSE POLICIES WHICH RESULTED IN MY DISCHARGE.  IT WAS A COMMON PRACTICE FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO FINANCIAL ADVISOR CLIENT SEMINARS AND PROSPECTING EVENTS.  OFTEN, SUCH REQUESTS WOULD COME FROM FINANCIAL ADVISORS FOR MONETARY CONTRIBUTIONS IN EXCESS OF $100.  ING T&E POLICY STATED THAT AS LONG AS THE ING REPRESENTATIVE ATTENDED THE FUNCTION, THEN THE $100 RULE DID NOT APPLY.  INEVITABLY, SCHEDULING CONFLICTS, LAST MINUTE AGENDA CHANGES AND/OR OTHER UNFORESEEN SITUATIONS AROSE WHERE THE ING REPRESENTATIVE-MYSELF-COULD NOT BE IN ATTENDANCE, BUT WAS STILL OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT.""
