  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS CLAIM WHICH WAS FILED BY THE ESTATE OF A LONG-TIME CLIENT AND PERSONAL FRIEND OF THE REPRESENTATIVE'S IS MISGUIDED.  MR. WIGHT WAS REMOVED AS THE BROKER OF RECORD MORE THAN A DECADE BEFORE THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE COMPLAINT OCCURRED, THEREFORE HE WAS NOT A PARTY TO THE ACTIVITY GIVING RISE TO THE COMPLAINT.  AS SUCH, MR. WIGHT DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS ASSERTED IN THE COMPLAINT AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE ALL DEFENSES AND LEGAL REMEDIES HE MAY HAVE.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, MR. WIGHT ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT TO AVOID THE PROTRACTED TIME, INCONVENIENCE AND EXPENSE OF DEFENDING THE ALLEGATIONS.  NOTHING IN THE SETTLEMENT CONSTITUTES AN ADMISSION OF ANY KIND.""
