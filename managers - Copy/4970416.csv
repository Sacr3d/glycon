  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CHARGES RESULTED FROM CHECKS THAT WERE SUBMITTED TO AN AIR FORCE CREDIT UNION AFTER I HAD BEEN HONORABLY DISCHARED FROM THE AIR FORCE.  I LEFT SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN THE ACCOUNT TO COVER THE CHECKS (TOTALLING LESS THAN $100).  THE CREDIT UNION READ THE ACCOUNT AS CLOSED AND RETURNED THE CHECKS INSTEAD OF CHECKING TO SEE IF FUNDS WERE IN THE ACCOUNT.  THE FUNDS WERE STILL IN THE ACCOUNT ON THE DATE OF ADJUDICATION.  EVEN THOUGH I PLED GUILTY, I WAS NOT FOUND GUILTY.  INSTEAD, ADJUDICATION WAS WITHHELD PENDING COMPLETION OF PROBATION AND THEN THE CHARGES WERE TO BE DISMISSED.  THE CHARGES, APPARENTLY, WERE NEVER DISMISSED AFTER PROBATION WAS COMPLETED.""
