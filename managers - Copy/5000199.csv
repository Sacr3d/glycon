  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN DECEMBER OF 2008 I WAS ORIGINALLY CHARGED WITH A FELONY BY THE ARRESTING OFFICER AFTER I WAS INVOLVED IN AN ALTERCATION AT A BAR IN NEW YORK.  I WAS NEVER INDICTED BY A GRAND JURY, THE PROSECUTOR QUICKLY DISMISSED THE FELONY CHARGES AND I PLED GUILTY TO A MISDEMEANOR CHARGE IN THE THIRD DEGREE, THE LOWEST FORM OF ASSAULT. I PLED GUILTY TO THIS CHARGE TO AVOID A LENGTHY AND COSTLY TRIAL AND BECAUSE I LACKED A WITNESS AND A VIDEOTAPE TO BACK UP MY CLAIM OF SELF-DEFENSE. I PERFORMED FOUR DAYS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.""
