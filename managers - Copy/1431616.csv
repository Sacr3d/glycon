  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC ADMINISTRATIVE RELEASE 34-43018, JULY 10, 2000: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\""COMMISSION\"") DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF INVESTORS TO INSTITUTE A PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDING PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 15(B)(6), AND 19(H), AND 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (\""EXCHANGE ACT\"") AGAINST TIMOTHY J. TYRRELL (\""TYRRELL\"") FOR WILLFULLY AIDING AND ABETTING AND CAUSING A BROKER-DEALER'S VIOLATION OF SECTION 15(C)(2) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND RULE 15C2-7 THEREUNDER BY ENTERING INTO AN ARRANGEMENT WITH A TRADER AT THE BROKER DEALER.  ON THE BASIS OF THE ORDER, THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT TYRRELL, ON BEHALF OF HIS FIRM, WAS A MARKET MAKER FOR A COMPANY'S STOCK DURING THE PRICE RISE PERIOD. IN THIS CAPACITY, TYRRELL SUBMITTED BID AND ASK QUOTES FOR THE COMPANY TO THE NASDAQ SYSTEM. THE QUOTES INDICATED TO THE MARKET THE PRICES AT WHICH TYRRELL'S FIRM WAS WILLING TO BUY AND SELL THE COMPANY'S STOCK. TYRRELL ALSO WAS A TRADER FOR A FIRM PROPRIETARY ACCOUNT DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD. THE MAJORITY OF THE TRADING PROFITS FROM THIS ACCOUNT WERE PAID TO A FIRM STOCKBROKER WHO AGGRESSIVELY RECOMMENDED THE COMPANY'S STOCK TO HIS CLIENTS AND OTHERS DURING THE PRICE RISE PERIOD.  DURING THE PRICE RISE PERIOD, TYRRELL WAS THE COMPANY'S HIGHEST BIDDING MARKET MAKER, THAT IS, THE MARKET MAKER THAT SPENT THE MOST TIME SUBMITTING SHARED OR EXCLUSIVE HIGH BID QUOTES TO THE NASDAQ SYSTEM. THE SECOND HIGHEST BIDDING MARKET MAKER DURING THE PERIOD WAS A TRADER AT ANOTHER BROKER-DEALER. PRIOR TO HIS EMPLOYMENT AT THIS BROKER-DEALER, THE TRADER WORKED WITH TYRRELL AT HIS FIRM. TYRRELL AND THE TRADER HAD AN ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY THE TRADER WOULD ENTER BID QUOTES FOR AND PURCHASE COMPANY SHARES ON TYRRELL'S FIRM'S BEHALF, AND, ON THE SAME DAY, RESELL THOSE SHARES TO TYRRELL'S FIRM. THE TRADER'S FIRM'S PURCHASES AND SUBSEQUENT RESALES OCCURRED ON 23 DAYS DURING THE PRICE RISE PERIOD. THE TRADER'S HIGH BID QUOTES FOR THE STOCK WERE OFTEN ENTERED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH TYRRELL'S HIGH BID QUOTES, GIVING THE MISLEADING APPEARANCE TO OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT THE TWO MARKET MAKERS WERE COMPETING FOR THE COMPANY'S STOCK. IN FACT, UNKNOWN TO THE MARKET, TYRRELL AND THE TRADER HAD THE ARRANGEMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE. AS A RESULT, THE MARKET RECEIVED MISLEADING INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEMAND FOR THE STOCK."",
