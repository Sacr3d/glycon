IN JUNE 2014, THE BANK TERMINATED ITS CLEARING AGREEMENT WITH IPI, AND IN AUGUST, BECAME AFFILIATED WITH ING/VOYA.  MY CLIENTS HAD JUST COMPLETED CHANGE OF DEALER (COD)FORMS TO IPI WHEN I JOINED THE BANK. MY OSJ WITH ING/VOYA WAS IN NEW JERSEY, AND I RECEIVED LITTLE GUIDANCE.  I CONTACTED EACH CLIENT, AND EXPLAINED THAT WE WOULD HAVE YET ANOTHER CHANGE.  I WANTED TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM, SINCE THE CLIENTS HAD ALREADY COMPLETED A NUMBER OF CODS.  WITH EACH CLIENT'S VERBAL APPROVAL, I USED THE COD FORMS THAT THEY HAD RECENTLY COMPLETED, WITH ALTERATIONS TO REMOVE IPI'S NAME AND MY CONTACT INFORMATION WITH THEM. SINCE I HAD RECEIVED CLIENT APPROVAL, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS WAS NOT COMPLIANT.""
