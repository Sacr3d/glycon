  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This complaint is without merit.  I recommended a suitable investment to an investor who sought out and was eligible to invest in private equity.  I provided full and accurate information about this investment in 2015, and the client performed his own review and diligence prior to investing.  Before he decided to invest, my client received a Private Placement Memorandum, the Limited Partnership Agreement, and the Disclosure Agreement and Subscription Booklet.  He also executed a Disclosure Letter that set forth the risks associated with this investment.  Unrealized losses on this investment at the time of the complaint are the result of private market valuations, sector forces and other economic factors, among other things, occurring approximately 5 years after his initial decision to invest and are outside of my control.  The departure of the fund manager appeared to upset the client, triggering this complaint, and he sought to exit the investment as a result.""
