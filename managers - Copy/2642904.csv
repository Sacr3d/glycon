  ""Regulator Statement"" : ""HEARING PANEL DECISION RENDERED FEBRUARY 7, 2014 WHEREIN RESPONDENT WAS FOUND TO HAVE ALLOWED A FIRM TO CONDUCT A SECURITIES BUSINESS WITH INSUFFICIENT NET CAPITAL, IN VIOLATION OF NASD RULE 2110 AND FINRA RULE 2010; FAILED TO FILE AN APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF A MATERIAL CHANGE IN BUSINESS OPERATIONS, IN VIOLATION OF NASD RULES 1017(A) AND 2110; AND FAILED TO APPEAR FOR TESTIMONY, IN VIOLATION OF FINRA RULES 8210 AND 2010.  JARKAS IS BARRED FOR THE FAILURE TO APPEAR FOR TESTIMONY. JARKAS ALSO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE HALF OF THE COST OF THE HEARING IN THE AMOUNT OF $5,436.14. IN LIGHT OF THE BAR, NO FURTHER SANCTIONS ARE IMPOSED FOR HIS OTHER VIOLATIONS. APPEALED TO THE NAC ON FEBRUARY 19, 2014. NAC decision rendered October 5, 2015 wherein the findings made are affirmed and the sanctions imposed by the Hearing Panel are modified by assessing an individual sanction for each violation. Jarkas is barred from associating with any FINRA member in any capacity and in light of imposing a bar, the NAC considers the additional sanctions assessed redundant and does not impose them. The bar is effective immediately upon the issuance of the decision. On November 10, 2015 Jarkas appealed the decision to the SEC. The bar remains in effect. SEC Decision rendered April 1, 2016, wherein the sanction against Jarkas was sustained. The sanction was based on the findings that Jarkas allowed his member firm to conduct a securities business without maintaining sufficient net capital on August 27 and 29, 2008, September 29 and 30, 2008, March 31, 2009, and April 27, 2009. The findings stated that Jarkas' own missteps primarily caused the net capital violations. Jarkas instructed an individual to trade securities in the firm's average price account that were not customer orders. Jarkas' firm maintained securities positions in the average price account for periods of up to seven business days before either allocating the positions to the customer's account, or, in some cases, liquidating the securities positions without a customer allocation. These trades were proprietary in that the firm-and not a customer-absorbed the market risk associated with the securities positions. The firm was engaging in proprietary trading, which impacted its net capital requirement. The firm failed to reflect the IRS payroll tax liability in its net capital computation and FOCUS filings for two quarters. Had the tax liability been reported, it would have shown that the firm was operating without sufficient net capital. The findings also stated that the SEC set aside the findings that Jarkas caused his firm to conduct a securities business without maintaining sufficient net capital on April 28, 2009. The findings also included that Jarkas failed to file a continuing membership application for approval of a material change in business operations. The firm was approved to engage in a number of business activities but proprietary trading was not one of them. The firm engaged in proprietary trading, which triggered a higher minimum net capital requirement of $100,000 and the corresponding filing requirement of an application under NASD Rule 1017(a), which Jarkas failed to file. FINRA found that Jarkas failed to appear for FINRA on-the-record testimony during its investigation.  The decision became final May 31, 2016.""
