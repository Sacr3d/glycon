  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN 1984 or 1985 I PURCHASED A SURFBOARD FROM THE FAIRFAX SURF SHOP IN FAIRFAX, VA BY WRITING A CHECK FOR BETWEEN $200 AND $300.  AFTER I PURCHASED THE SURFBOARD I MOVED, AND CHANGED BANKS.  DURING THIS TIME, THE CHECK I WROTE FOR THE SURFBOARD BOUNCED, AND THE MERCHANT AND MY OLD BANK ATTEMPTED TO NOTIFY ME, BUT COULD NOT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE MY NEW ADDRESS.  I HAD NO INTENTION OF WRITING A BAD CHECK, AND THIS RESULTED FROM ME NOT BEING DILIGENT ENOUGH IN BALANCING MY CHECKBOOK, AND THE MERCHANT AND MY BANK NOT BEING ABLE TO REACH ME.  EVENTUALLY, I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE BAD CHECK BECAUSE I WAS SUBPOENAED TO APPEAR IN COURT TO FACE THE CHARGES, WHICH WERE FELONY CHARGES BECAUSE THE CHECK WAS WRITTEN FOR AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN $200.   IN COURT I TOLD MY END OF THE STORY, AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT I HAD NO INTENT OF WRITING A BAD CHECK.  I HAD NO PRIOR RECORD WHATSOEVER SO I PAID FOR THE SURFBOARD AND APOLOGIZED.""
