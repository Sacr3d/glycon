  ""Type"" : ""Compromise"",
  ""Disposition"" : ""Resolved"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Upon my final few months with American Income Life, I was owed roughly $5-7,000 dollars for sales which, at the direction of my supervisors, were to put underneath my agents that were with me at the sales and to have them pay me on it. Multiple agents left without paying me my part of the sales which led to a decline in my cash flow. At the time I was trying to stay afloat with paying rent and bills. Unfortunately it led to this situation. I was not aware that the compromise could have a negative impact in the future and I would have paid it in full had I known it would be viewed negatively for future employment purposes.""
