  ""Broker Comment"" : ""After three meetings, an annuity product was chosen by the client from several recommended fixed and variable investment options that would reduce her market risk. At that time, it met all of her needs including her primary goal of protecting a portion of her overall assets from market volatility that she was anticipating as a result of the 2016 presidential election.  She was aware of surrender charges and length of the annuity contract.  After the first anniversary, the stock market was up and she was disappointed in the interest credited. Complaint was the result of her dissatisfaction that surrender charges could not be waived.""
