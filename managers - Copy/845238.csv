I NEVER MADE THE STATEMENT TO THE CUSTOMER  THAT HE COULD REDEEM HIS BONDS ON THE TRADE DATE ANNIVERSARY AT PRINCIPAL.  I DID TELL THE CUSTOMER  THAT THE BONDS COULD BE CALLED AND IF CALLED, PRINCIPAL WOULD BE RETURNED.  CONCERNING PENALTY, I SPECIFICALLY TOLD THE CUSTOMER  THAT IF HE SOLD HIS BONDS EITHER BEFORE MATURITY OR CALL DATE THERE WAS NO PENALTY FOR EARLY WITHDRAWAL, AS IS THE CASE WITH A CD, BUT THAT THE SALES PROCEEDS COULD BE MORE OR LESS THAN PAR VALUE-WE COULD NOT GUARANTEE A SLES PRICE OR MARKET VALUE.""
