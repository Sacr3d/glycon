I MET WITH HER SEVERAL TIMES AFTER THIS PURCHASE, TO RE-EXPLAIN THE COVERAGE, ASSIST HER IN WITHDRAWING FROM AN ANNUITY TO PAY THE PREMIUM, AND CONTINUE WITH DISCUSSIONS REGARDING HER INVESTMENTS.   MY BROKER DEALER AT THE TIME DENIED THIS COMPLAINT.  THERE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN A COMPLAINT IF SHE HAD NOT MET WITH AN UNSCRUPULOUS PLANNER WHO PERSUADED THE CLIENT TO MAKE CHANGES TO HER CONTRACTS.  SHE WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT HER INVESTMENTS WERE FAULTY.  HE THEREUPON CONVINCED HER TO CHANGE HER POLICIES, PAY OVER $100,000 IN SURRENDER CHARGES AND DISCREDITED EVERYTHING THAT SHE HAD ALREADY DONE.""
