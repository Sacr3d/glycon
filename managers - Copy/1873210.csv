THESE TRADERS CONSPIRED IN VARIOUS SCHEMES WITH 15 PURPORTED STOCK LOAN \""FINDERS\"" TO SKIM PROFITS ON STOCK LOAN TRANSACTIONS. THE DEFENDANTS EARNED OVER $8 MILLION FROM THEIR UNLAWFUL SCHEMES OVER A PERIOD OF NEARLY SIX YEARS. THE COMMISSION ALLEGES THAT FROM AS FAR BACK AS 1999 UNTIL 2005, THE STOCK LOAN TRADERS ROUTINELY DEFRAUDED THE BROKERAGE FIRMS THAT EMPLOYED THEM AND OTHERS BY ENGAGING IN COLLUSIVE LOAN TRANSACTIONS AND CAUSING THE FIRMS TO PAY SHAM FINDER FEES TO COMPANIES CONTROLLED BY THE TRADERS THEMSELVES OR BY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES. ACTING AS FRONTS FOR THE TRADERS, THESE COMPANIES RECEIVED HEFTY FINDER FEES ON SEVERAL THOUSAND STOCK LOAN TRANSACTIONS EVEN THOUGH THEY DID NOT PROVIDE ANY LEGITIMATE FINDING SERVICES AND, IN MANY CASES, WERE SIMPLY SHELL COMPANIES THAT WERE NOT EVEN INVOLVED IN THE STOCK LOAN BUSINESS. WHILE AN INDIVIDUAL WAS CO-HEAD OF THE STOCK LOAN TRADING DESK AT A MEMBER FIRM, HE ENGAGED IN SEVERAL SCHEMES TO DEFRAUD THE FIRM USING A SHELL COMPANY THAT HE CONTROLLED AND CAUSED HIS FIRM TO PAY SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS IN SHAM FINDER FEES TO THE SHELL COMPANY. PIANELLI COLLUDED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TO INCREASE HIS ILLEGAL PROFITS THROUGH CIRCULAR LOAN TRANSACTIONS KNOWN AS \""RING\"" AND \""RUN-THROUGH\"" DEALS.  PIANELLI ALSO SCHEMED WITH ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL TO DEFRAUD OTHER MEMBER FIRMS BY PAYING SHAM FINDER FEES TO A PURPORTED FINDER OWNED BY PIANELLI'S WIFE."",
