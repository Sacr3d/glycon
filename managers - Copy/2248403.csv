  ""Allegations"" : ""BRIAN CLARKE WAS TERMINATED FOR VIOLATION OF FIRM POLICY. SPECIFICALLY, MR. CLARKE PURCHASED MUTUAL FUNDS FOR CLIENTS WITH WHOM HE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED THE SECURITIES, AND WHICH WERE NOT ON THE FIRM'S APPROVED PRODUCT LIST, AND DID SO WITHOUT THE CLIENTS' AUTHORIZATION.  MR. CLARKE ALSO SUBSEQUENTLY CHANGED THE TRADE INFORMATION FOR THE TRANSACTION FROM SOLICITED TO UNSOLICITED.  FINALLY, MR. CLARKE WAS NOT TRUTHFUL ABOUT THESE ACTS DURING THE COURSE OF AN EMPLOYEE RELATIONS INVESTIGATION."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE TRADE IN QUESTION INVOLVED AN OPEN-END MUTUAL FUND THAT WAS SUITABLE FOR THE CLIENT AND MET THE CLIENT'S OBJECTIVES.  HOWEVER, I LATER LEARNED THAT IT WAS NOT ON THE FIRM'S APPROVED LIST.  I RESPECTUFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE FIRM'S ASSERTION THAT I WAS NOT TRUTHFUL DURING THE COURSE OF AN INVESTIGATON, AND ITS SUGGESTION THAT I INTENTIONALLY MISMARKED THE TRADE INFORMATION.  THE CUSTOMER WAS PLEASED WITH THE TRADE IN QUESTION AND DID NOT INITIATE A CUSTOMER COMPLAINT.""
