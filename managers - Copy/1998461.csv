HER EXISTING LIFE INSURANCE POLICY WAS OVER $100,000, BY FUNDING A NEW POLICY IT WOULD REDUCE THE ESTATE AND PROVIDE LIQUIDITY AT DEATH.  THE NEW POLICY WOULD PROVIDE INCOME TAX AND ESTATE TAX FREE TO THE HEIRS.  IF THE CLIENT KEPT THE ORIGINAL POLICY, THEN IT WOULD HAVE A 3 YEAR LOOK BACK AND HAVE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THE HEIRS.  THE CLIENT DID NOT WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE IT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN HER ESTATE.""
