  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE OFFENSE OCCURRED IN WESTFIELD, MASS WHERE STEVEN WAS ATTENDING COLLEGE.  ONE NIGHT, I WAS WALKING HOME FROM A FRIEND'S HOUSE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL, AND HE PUT HIS HAND THROUGH A WINDOW OF A LOCAL BUSINESS DOWN THE STREET FROM HIS HOUSE.  STEVEN ADMITTED HIS MISTAKE TO THE LOCAL POLICE, AND WENT TO THE POLICE STATION TO GIVE A WRITTEN CONFESSION THT NIGHT OF WHAT HE HAD DONE.  HE MET WITH THE OWNER OF THE BUSINESS AND MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO PAY FOR THE WINDOW.  IN COURT, THE CASE WAS DISMISSED UPON PAYMENT TO THE OWNER, WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE BY THE TIME HE HAD APPEARED IN COURT.  IN ADDITION TO PAYING FOR THE WINDOW, HE HAD TO PAY A FINE OF $50 AND COURT FEES OF $35.  ALL PAYMENTS WERE MADE AND THE CASE WAS DISMISSED.""
