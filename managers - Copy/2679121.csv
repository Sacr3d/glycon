  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Mullaly consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he failed to inform his member firm that he had control as a power of attorney over an outside securities account that was held by a relative at another firm. The findings stated that on the power of attorney form, Mullaly indicated to the outside firm that he was not affiliated with or employed by a firm. Additionally, although the power of attorney gave Mullaly full trading authority over the account, as well as the ability to make withdrawals, he did not disclose the account to his firm at any time. To the contrary, Mullaly signed and submitted annual compliance questionnaires to his firm, in which he falsely represented that he did not have any undisclosed outside securities accounts. The findings also stated that Mullaly made several trades in the account that were prohibited by his firm because they involved securities on its restricted list. Mullaly also made several trades in the account that required pre-approval by his firm because they involved securities that were on its research list."",
