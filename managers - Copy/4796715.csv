  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In response to the allegations made by client on 3/16/2016 in which he baselessly infers that I sold him a Variable annuity product without disclosing the facts that the investment was subject to risk is false. I would like it noted that I am not employed at US Bancorp Investments any longer for personal values, not any disciplinary actions. With that said, I was not allowed to view my notes on file for the client but I did speak with a compliance official at US Bancorp, who is handling the complaint on their end.  I told him exactly what I remember of the events that transpired with the client and he said that it basically matched my notes. Those facts are this:  I met with the client multiple times, and did not lead with any product, I did a full financial plan, using the software that US Bancorp had at our disposal. The money this man was looking to invest was in a bank CD IRA earning a minimal amount of interest.  In doing the plan for the client, I highlighted his risks, being that he had a business to run, had debt from a newer home that he had just built, and a younger wife.  He never indicated that his main concern was that he needed this money for an emergency, but rather he needed to create retirement income from the money down the road for both he and his wife. His concern was for the market and the risks associated with it. To that end, I explained to him the benefit of a VA with living benefit riders, in this case it was AXA Cornerstone. As I always have done with these products, I disclosed the \""three buckets of money'' you get when you purchase a VA with a living rider and a death benefit. One, is the cash value, which I say is your \""walk away money\"", and can fluctuate based on market performance, and has CDSC charges that I discuss. Second, is the income bucket, in this case I showed him how Axa will provide a living benefit based on the initial premium with a 6% credit the first two years and then treasury rates plus 2% thereafter with a minimum of 4%.  I explained how this works and how it would benefit him based on HIS plan to create retirement income and not be dependent on the stock market completely for his returns. The last bucket is the death benefit, which I explained to him will depend on how much money has been withdrawn from the account, etc. The fact this money was earning him nothing was the real risk to him, as the report highlighted. He acknowledged those risks as I explained them to him; furthermore, he had to sign the disclosures I presented to him that USBI provided. This investment was made over two years ago, has he reviewed both the income portion of the investment and the cash value both then and now?  It will show exactly why we did this, given the need for income in the future. Has the current Financial Advisor explained the features and benefits to him? The notes are obvious, based on his financial plan. The current advisor should have access to all of the notes. I feel that this claim is unwarranted and baseless. The fact I no longer work there, and had to do what was best for my family, I believe is a factor here. I had established a good relationship with this man and if I was still working there and able to highlight why we bought this investment, this claim probably would not have been made. All clients require education and guidance during periods of market turmoil, and this is no different.  The fact I left this company has no bearing on the fact that the investment solution was in his best interest at the time and unless something has materially changed in his life since we were working together, still is.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CLIENT'S REQUEST IS DENIED. THE CLIENTS INDICATED THEIR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE FIRM AND ACCOUNT PERFORMANCE DURING THE A MEETING WITH THE FORMER ADVISOR. THEY COMPLETED A RISK QUESTIONNAIRE, BUT DID NOT COMPLETE THE ACCOUNT REVIEW. THEY TOLD THE NEW FA THAT THEY WOULD CALL IF THEY WERE GOING TO KEEP THEIR ACCOUNT WITH THE FIRM. THE FA SCHEDULED A FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT,AND THE CLIENTS DID NOT ATTEND OR CALL TO RESCHEDULE. IN A FOLLOW-UP TO A MAILING, THE FA CONTACTED THE CLIENTS 2 YEARS LATER, AND THEY AGAIN VOICED THEIR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE FORMER FA, PERFORMANCE AND THE CURRENT FA. THEY SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT, WHERE THEY REVIEWED GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND TIME HORIZON, AND COMPLETED ANOTHER RISK QUESTIONNAIRE WHICH REFLECTED BALANCED TOWARD GROWTH. THE FA MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO REPOSITION WITHIN THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUND FAMILY SO THAT THE CLIENTS WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL SALES CHARGES. THE CLIENTS ACCEPTED THE RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH ALIGNED TO THE STATED GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND RISK TOLERANCE. THE FA SCHEDULED QUARTERLY CONTACTS, AND NOTES REFLECT MANY CALLS BETWEEN THE QUARTERLY CONTACTS. IN AUGUST 2011, THE MARKET DECLINED AND THE CLIENTS WENT TO THE BRANCH WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT. THEY WERE ANGRY WITH THE MARKET DECLINES, AND THE FA PUT TOGETHER A CONSERVATIVE RECOMMENDATION. HE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT THE CLIENTS, BUT THEY WERE UNAVAILABLE TO REVIEW THE RECOMMENDATIONS INITIALLY, AND THEN DID NOT RETURN THE CALLS. ON SEPTEMBER 22, 2011, THEY WENT TO THE BRANCH AGAIN WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT. THE CLIENTS BEHAVIOR WAS DESCRIBED ON BOTH VISITS AS HOSTILE, WHICH RESULTED IN THE FIRM ASKING THE CLIENT TO TRANSFER THEIR ACCOUNT.""
