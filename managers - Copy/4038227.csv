  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ACCORDING TO THE IR, HE MET WITH THE CLIENTS AND THEIR MOTHER TO DISCUSS INVESTMENT OPTIONS FOR THE CLIENTS' MONEY AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH INVESTMENT. HE STATED EACH OF THE FOLLOWING INVESTMENTS WERE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL: CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, CORPORATE AND MINICIPAL BONDS, MUTUAL FUNDS, FIXED ANNUITITES AND VARIABLE ANNUITIES. THE IR INDICATED, WHEN DISCUSSING THE RISKS OF THE INVESTMENTS, HE INFORMED THE CLIENTS THERE MAY BE A CHANCE THEY COULD LOSE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE MONEY INVESTED. HE STATED DURING THE CLIENTS' SECOND APPOINTMENT, THEY INFORMED HIM THEY DID NOT INTEND TO SPEND THE MONEY FOR TEN YEARS AND THEY DESIRED MARKET APPRECIATION. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING, BASED ON THE CLIENTS' INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, THE CLIENTS CHOSE THE VARIABLE ANNUITY. THE IR INDICATED HE AGAIN DISCUSSED THE DETAILS OF THE VARIABLE ANNUITY TO INCLUDE FEES, EXPENSES AND PENALTIES. OUR RECORDS INDICATE THE CLIENTS SIGNED THE METLIFE PURCHASE CONFIRMATION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM ON MARCH 20, 2002. IT IS OUR OPINION, THE IR DISCUSSED THE RISKS OF THE VARIABLE ANNUITY PURCHASED AND THE CLIENTS AGREED TO THE SUB-ACCOUNT ALLOCATIONS CHOSEN. BASED ON MY REVIEW, WE WILL NOT BE MAKING ANY ADJUSTMENT TO THEIR ACCOUNT.  ""
