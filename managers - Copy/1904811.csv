  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I DENY ANY AND ALL ALLEGATIONS PERTAINING TO THIS WRITTEN COMPLIANT AND FURTHER STATE THAT I DID NOT MISREPRESENT THIS MUTUTAL FUND IN ANY WAY. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THE FACT THAT THIS FUND WAS NOT SOLICITED TO [CUSTOMER]. CLIENT WAS WELL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS PURCHASING A MUTUTAL FUND WITH NO GUARANTEES WHATSOEVER. UPON PURCHASE, [CUSTOMER] RECEIVED ALL THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURES PERTAING TO THE FUND IN QUESTION. [CUSTOMER] PURCHASED THE SCHWAB YIELD PLUS FUND (SWYSX)AFTER AN INBOUND PHONE DISCUSSION REGARDING INVESTMENT OPTIONS FOR PROCEEDS FROM A RECENTLY MATURED INVESTMENT. AS THE FUND'S NAV STARTED TO DROP THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER MADE AVAILABLE HIS THOUGHTS TO BOTH THE FINANCIAL CONSULTANTS AND THE SHAREHOLDERS. [CUSTOMER] WAS KEPT UP TO DATE ON THE SITUATION WITH THE FUND AND WAS SPOKEN TO ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. THIS FUND WAS A VICTIM OF THE DOWNTURN IN THE CREDIT MARKETS AND DROPPED IN VALUE. [CUSTOMER] HAD ADEQUATE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION ABOUT THE SITUTATION WITH SWYSX AND MADE HIS OWN ULTIMATE DECISIONS TO STAY IN THE FUND WITH HOPES OF A TURN AROUND. UPON MAKING THE DECISION TO LIQUIDATE THE FUND [CUSTOMER] REALIZED A PRINCIPLE LOSS OF $31,069 FROM HIS INTITIAL $125,000 INVESTMENT. WHAT HE FAILED TO DISCLOSE WAS THE FACT THAT HE HAD REALIZED ROUGHLY $9000 IN CASH DIVIDENDS DURING THE TIME HE HELD THE FUND. [CUSTOMER] HAD NUMEROUS OTHER MUTUAL FUND INVESTMENTS, HE WAS WELL AWARE OF THE RISK INVOLVED WITH THESE TYPES OF HOLDINGS, AND HE COULD HAVE SOLD AT ANY TIME.  THESE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE FINANCIAL REPRESENTATIVE ARE FALSE AND WITHOUT MERIT. CLIENT HAS AGREED TO A $3000 SETTLEMENT OFFERED BY CHARLES SCHWAB WITHOUT ADMITTING ANY WRONG DOING ON THE PART OF THE FIRM OR THE FINANCIAL REPRESENTATIVE.""
