  ""Broker Comment"" : ""WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER, I RECEIVED A RIDE FROM A HIGH SCHOOL ACQUAINTANCE.  WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE, THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE WAS IN POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA.  HE WAS PULLED OVER FOR A TRAFFIC VIOLATION AND THE VEHICLE WAS SEARCHED.  THE POLICE FOUND MARIJUANA IN THE VEHICLE.  THE DRIVER DENIED IT WAS HIS AND THEREFORE ALL OCCUPANTS OF THE VEHICLE WERE CHARGED.  ALL CHARGES AGAINST ME WERE SUBSEQUENTLY DROPPED OR DISMISSED.""
