After the RR informed the customer that it was possible, the customer contacted the insurance company and liquidated her policies, with the proceeds going into her VA. Thus, causing a taxable event.

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The RR filed an Errors & Omissions (E&O) claim with his insurance carrier. The customer declined the E&O settlement and elected to resolve the matter with the IRS, reversing the tax liability. On June 9, 2017, the customer withdrew her request for taxes incurred and the difference in net social security benefits. The Firm settled the complaint by reimbursing the customer for the additional tax advice and filing an amended 2015 tax return. In addition, the customer accepted a settlement from the Firm for the time taken to resolve the matter on her own.""
