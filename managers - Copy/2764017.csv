  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I INITIALLY MET WITH THE CLIENT ON 5/8/06 TO DISCUSS ROLLOVER OPTIONS FOR HER 401K, INCLUDING THE ROLLOVER PROCESS AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE CLIENT WAS LEAVING HER CURRENT JOB TO GO INTO BUSINESS WITH HER DAUGHTER, WHERE IT WAS EXPECTED THE NEW BUSINESS WOULD BE FINANCED WITH A BUSINESS LOAN. I REFERRED HER TO A BUSINESS SPECIALIST. I TOLD THE CLIENT THAT SHE WOULD ALSO NEED TO SEEK LEGAL AND TAX ADVICE BEFORE MAKING ANY DECISIONS.  THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, I SPOKE/MET WITH THE CLIENT MANY TIMES. THE BUSINESS LOAN WAS DENIED AND AN IRA DISTRIBUTION WOULD FINANCE THE BUSINESS. I EXPLAINED THE TAXES, FEES AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TYPE OF DISTRIBUTION, HER OUTSTANDING 401K LOAN, AS WELL AS, THE TAX WITHHOLDING OPTIONS, INCLUDING THE % TO WITHHOLD.   JUST PRIOR TO THE ROLLOVER, WE MET AND THE CLIENT STATED HER GOALS WERE TO BECOME A BUSINESS OWNER, BUT ALSO WANTED A RETIREMENT NEST EGG TO REBUILD. WE AGAIN DISCUSSED THE TAX IMPLICATIONS OF A DISTRIBUTION AND CONTACTED HER 401K PROVIDER, WHERE A REP PROVIDED THE SAME INFORMATION. THE CLIENT DECIDED TO PROCEED WITH THE ROLLOVER.  THE EXPECTED ROLLOVER WAS $287K; WITH A DISTRIBUTION OF $150K. WHILE COMPLETING THE DISTRIBUTION FORM, WE DISCUSSED HER WITHHOLDING CHOICES. I REMINDED HER ABOUT THE 10% PENALTY FOR EARLY WITHDRAWAL. ON 8/18, THE DISTRIBUTION INCREASED TO $175,000. ON 8/28, WE DISCUSSED THE PORTFOLIO FOR THE REMAINING ASSETS AND RECOMMENDED A DIVERSE MUTUAL FUND PORTFOLIO. A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER, THE CLIENT REQUESTED ANOTHER DISTRIBUTION.   THE CLIENT CALLED ME FROM HER CPA'S OFFICE SURPRISED ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION TAX OBLIGATIONS, AND ACTED AS IF SHE WAS NEVER GIVEN ANY CHOICES. FROM THE START, THE CLIENT WENT FROM INVESTING THE ENTIRE ROLLOVER TO A REQUESTING A TOTAL DISTRIBUTION OF $205K. THE CLIENT'S CLAIM HAS NO MERIT AS TAX OBLIGATIONS, FEES, AND OPTIONS WERE REPEATEDLY DISCUSSED. IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE CLIENT OBTAIN TAX ADVICE, AS I AM NOT A TAX ADVISOR.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""BASED UPON MY MEMORY OF THIS CLIENT AND TRANSACTION, HE EXPRESSED A NEED FOR INCOME AND BEING RISK AVERSE TO THE EQUITY MARKETS.  THE CLIENT WAS ALSO MORE COMFORTABLE WITH GUARANTEES OF INCOME IN THE FORM OF AN ANNUITY OVER THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVING FULL PARTICIPATION IN THE MARKET USING A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT OR MUTUAL FUNDS.  THIS INVESTMENT MET HIS INVESTMENT NEEDS AND RISK TOLERANCE AT THE TIME OF SALE.  THE CLIENTS NEEDS AND RISK TOLERANCE MAY HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE INITIAL TRANSACTION.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT HE IS CURRENTLY SPEAKING TO AN INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISOR OUTSIDE OF CHASE INVESTMENTS.""
