  ""Allegations"" : ""06/26/00GS: SEC NEW DIGEST, ISSUE 2000-115, DATED JUNE 16, 2000, ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS DISCLOSES: INVESTMENT ADVISER AND CEO SANCTIONED FOR FAILING TO ADEQUATELY DISCLOSE CLIENT REFERRAL ARRANGEMENT. ON JUNE 15, THE COMMISSION INSTITUTED PROCEEDINGS CHARGING THAT BJORN K. BORGEN, FORMER PRESIDENT OF A MEMBER FIRM, DEFRAUDED CERTAIN ADVISORY CLIENTS OF THE FIRM BY FAILING TO DISCLOSE AN ARRANGEMENT TO USE ADVISORY CLIENTS' BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS TO PAY FOR CLIENT REFERRALS, FAILING TO DISCLOSE A MATERIAL CHANGE IN FOUNDERS' ORDER-EXECUTION POLICY, AND BY FAILING TO OBTAIN BEST EXECUTION OF TRADES FOR THESE ADVISORY CLIENTS FROM 1992 THROUGH MID-1995. ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION'S ORDER, THE FIRM ENTERED INTO AN UNDISCLOSED ARRANGEMENT WITH WILLIAM O. FOSTER (\""FOSTER\""), A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE, TO ROUTE CLIENT TRADE ORDERS TO BROKER-DEALERS WITH WHOM FOSTER WAS ASSOCIATED IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE HIM FOR REFERRING CLIENTS TO THE FIRM. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE FIRM CHANGED ITS EXECUTION POLICY IN 1992 TO COMPLY WITH FOSTER'S DEMANDS FOR INCREASED COMPENSATION. THE FIRM FAILED TO OBTAIN BEST EXECUTION AND ALSO FAILED TO DISCLOSE THE CHANGE IN EXECUTION POLICY. THE FIRM'S PREVIOUS EXECUTION POLICY WAS TO BUNCH SAME-DAY, SAME-SECURITY PURCHASES (OR SALES) FOR THE MUTUAL FUNDS (THE \""FUNDS\"") AND ALL PRIVATE ACCOUNTS THAT IT MANAGED. THE FIRM CHANGED ITS POLICY, UNBUNCHED THE TRADE ORDERS, AND EXECUTED TRADES FOR CERTAIN PRIVATE ACCOUNTS LATER THAN THE TRADE ORDERS OF THE FUNDS AND OTHER ACCOUNTS, RESULTING IN WORSE PRICES OVER THE THREE AND ONE-HALF YEARS. FURTHER, THE UNBUNCHED PRIVATE ACCOUNTS PAID COMMISSIONS OF 20 CENTS PER SHARE ON SAME-DAY TRANSACTIONS IN THE SAME SECURITIES AS THE FUNDS AND OTHER PRIVATE ACCOUNTS WHILE THE LATTER PAID MUCH LOWER COMMISSIONS (TYPICALLY SIX TO EIGHT CENTS PER SHARE)."",
