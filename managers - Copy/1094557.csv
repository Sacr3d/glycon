  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Claimant was a long-time client of Sturniolo and Associates and is still a client. Over the years, I not only provided services regarding investments, but spent numerous hours assisting Claimants with their estate and other planning, for which I was not separately compensated. I also helped the client when her husband unexpectantly died. I helped her with all elements of her transition even though his sudden death left her unprepared and financially in a hole. She leaned on me to get her business up and running and to transition to a new smaller house and to sell her cars and buy one. The investments at issue are all suitable for Claimant based on her financial position and investment objectives, as well as other factors at the time they were made, and performed well for Claimants. In fact, the client investments were profitable every single year since we started working together. During the 50% downturn in 2007 to 2009, the clients made money each of those years. I deny all claims as I maintain that Claimant's investments were suitable and all actions I took regarding the client's investments were in furtherance of their overall objectives and goals. I am prepared to defend the investments at issue in an arbitration.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CUSTOMERS WERE A YOUNG COUPLE WHO CAME TO ME TO OBTAIN LONG TERM AND ESTATE PLANNING ADVICE REGARDING THEIR ASSETS.  I SPENT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME WITH THE CUSTOMERS ANALYZING THEIR LONG TERM SITUATION.  I PROVIDED THEM WITH COMPREHENSIVE WRITTEN INFORMATION ON ESTATE TAXES, GIFT TAXES, AND INCOME TAXES.  I GAVE THEM NUMEROUS ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO THEIR CONCERNS INCLUDING THE USE OF TRUST, FAMILY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND LIFE INSURANCE TRUSTS.  WE DISCUSSED THE SELLING OF CERTAIN APPRECIATED ASSETS AND THE CAPITAL GAINS CONSEQUENCES OF THE SALE OF THOSE ASSETS.  WE DISCUSSED ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS INCLUDING VARIABLE ANNUITIES AS A MTHOD OF DEFERRING ANY FURTHER INCOME TAXES.  AS AN ACCOUNTANT, THE CUSTOMER WAS AWARE OF THE IMPACT OF CAPITAL GAINS ON THE SALE OF THOSE ASSETS.  AS A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF A MUTUAL FUND COMPANY, THE OTHER CUSTOMER WAS AWARE OF THE TAX TREATMENT OF MUTUAL FUND DISTRIBUTIONS AND THE IMPACT OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON THE SALE OF MUTUAL FUNDS.  THE CUSTOMERS DECIDED TO REALIZE SOME CAPITAL GAINS NOW BY INVESTING IN ANNUITIES SO THAT THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY TAES ON THEIR MUTUAL FUND DISTRIBUTIONS.  THEIR COMPLAINT THAT I SHOULD PAY THEIR CAPITAL GAINS TAX NEVER WENT FURTHER THAN AN INITIAL LETTER.""
