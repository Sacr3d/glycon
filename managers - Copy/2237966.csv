  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I MET THE CLIENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MARCH 2008. HE WAS A NEW CUSTOMER WITH NO EXISTING ACCOUNTS WITH WELLS FARGO AND REQUESTED A MEETING WITH ME TO DISCUSS HIS 401K ROLLOVER. AT THIS MEETING, HE ASKED ME ABOUT MY INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY & EXPERIENCE IN THE BUSINESS; HE DECIDED TO WORK WITH ME. AFTER THE FUNDS ARRIVED AT WELLS FARGO, WE MET TO DISCUSS INVESTMENT OPTIONS. THE CLIENT CAME TO THE MEETING WITH INVESTMENT OPTIONS THAT HE HAD RESEARCHED AND WAS INTERESTED IN. TWO OF THE FUNDS HE WAS INTERESTED IN WERE THE ALPINE FUND AND THE THORNBURG FUND. I AGREED THESE APPEARED TO GOOD MUTUAL FUNDS WITH GOOD RATINGS & HISTORICAL RETURNS. I SUGGESTED WE PURCHASE THESE FUNDS IN HIS IRA ALONG WITH OTHER INVESTMENTS FOR DIVERSIFICATION. AT THAT TIME, THE CLIENT SAID HE DID NOT NEED THESE FUNDS NOR DID HE NEED INCOME; THAT HE HAD ADDITIONAL MONEY ELSEWHERE AND, IN HIS WORDS, IF HIS INVESTMENTS DID WELL HE WOULD BRING OVER MORE MONEY. IN MAY, THE CLIENT WANTED TO INVEST ADDITIONAL MONEY & REQUESTED MY ADVICE. AGAIN HE STATED THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE NEED FOR THE FUNDS OR FOR INCOME. FOR FURTHER DIVERSIFICATION, I RECOMMENDED INTERNATIONAL FUNDS. HE AGREED AND A GLOBAL FUND WAS PURCHASED. FOR FURTHER DIVERSIFICATION AND PROTECTION, WE DID PURCHASED PRINCIPAL PROTECTED MARKET LINKED CDS, BOTH IN HIS IRA AND NON-QUALIFIED ACCOUNT. 40% OF HIS NON-QUALIFIED ACCOUNT IS INVESTED IN PRINCIPAL PROTECTED CDS. BETWEEN THE INVESTMENTS IN THE CLIENT'S IRA AND NON-QUALIFIED ACCOUNT I BELIEVE THE CLIENT HAD A BALANCED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WITH A GOOD DEAL OF DIVERSIFICATION. THE CLIENT'S ALLEGATIONS CONTRADICT THE INFORMATION HE PROVIDED TO ME AT OUR MEETINGS AND WHAT WAS DOCUMENTED ON THE ACCOUNT APPLICATION/AGREEMENT. BESIDES THE MEETINGS REFERENCED ABOVE, THE CLIENT WAS CONSULTED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AFTER THE INVESTMENTS WERE PURCHASED; HE WAS NOT LEFT UNINFORMED OF THE STATUS OR STATE OF HIS ACCOUNT. I BELIEVE THE CLIENT IS TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS.""
