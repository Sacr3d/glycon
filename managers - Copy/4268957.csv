  ""Allegations"" : ""FINRA RULE 2010: WHILE WORKING AS A BANKING ASSOCIATE AT A BANK, HIS MEMBER FIRM, HAMBLIN RECEIVED A WATCH VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $2,000 AS A GIFT FROM A BANK CLIENT, WHICH VIOLATED THE FIRM'S POLICIES. AFTER HAMBLIN'S FIRM ACQUIRED ANOTHER MEMBER FIRM AND WHILE REGISTERED WITH THE ACQUIRED FIRM, HAMBLIN WAS INTERVIEWED BY FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS IN CONNECTION WITH A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF SOME BANK CLIENTS. SOME MANAGERS OF THE ACQUIRED FIRM AND AN INVESTIGATOR OF THE BANK ATTENDED THE INTERVIEW. DURING THE INTERVIEW, HAMBLIN STATED THAT ONE OF THE BANK'S CLIENTS BEING INVESTIGATED BOUGHT A WATCH FOR HIM, AND CLAIMED THAT HE SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED THE CLIENT FOR THE WATCH. IN FACT, HAMBLIN HAD NOT REIMBURSED THE BANK CLIENT. THEREAFTER, HAMBLIN SENT AN EMAIL TO THE BANK INVESTIGATOR AND A MANAGER OF THE ACQUIRED FIRM, IN WHICH HE REPEATED HIS FALSE CLAIM THAT HE PURCHASED THE WATCH. HAMBLIN ATTACHED TO THE EMAIL A RECEIPT FOR A BOND THAT HE CLAIMED EVIDENCED THAT HE PURCHASED THE WATCH. THE RECEIPT FOR THE BOND DISCLOSED THAT ONE OF THE BANK CLIENTS PURCHASED THE BOND DURING THE SAME TIME HAMBLIN HAD RECEIVED THE WATCH. LATER, HAMBLIN MET WITH COUNSEL HIRED BY THE FIRM IN CONNECTION WITH ITS ONGOING INVESTIGATION. HAMBLIN AGAIN DENIED THAT THE WATCH WAS A GIFT, AND CLAIMED THAT HE PAID $2,000 TO A FRIEND - BUT NOT ONE OF THE BANK CLIENTS - WHO HAD PURCHASED THE WATCH ONLINE. EACH OF HAMBLIN'S STATEMENTS THAT HE PURCHASED THE WATCH WAS FALSE."",
