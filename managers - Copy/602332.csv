WE DID NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LOSSES OCCURED AT THE TIME OF THE OCTOBER 1987 MARKET CRASH. A SETTLEMENT WAS DEEMED PREFERABLE TO A PROTRACTED PROCEEDING BECAUSE:   1-MY PARTNER NO LONGER WORKED AT TUCKER ANTHONY.   2-THE FIRM WAS WITTING TO SETTLE RATHER THAN PICK-UP   3-I WAS WILLING TO SETTLE JUST TO BRING THIS TO AN END.   IT ALREADY WAS 2 1/2 YRS & UNTOLD MEETING & FUSTRATION FOR   ME.""
