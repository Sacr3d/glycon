  ""Broker Comment"" : ""APPROXIMATELY $20,000 IN COMMISSIONS WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM ME FOR THE ALLEDGEDLY UNAUTHORIZED TRADES. WHEN I OPENED MR. DORSEY'S ACCOUNT, I WAS GIVEN DISCRETION TO TRADE ONE STOCK, NUCLEAR PHARMACY, AS I SAW FIT BECAUSE MR. DORSEY TRAVELLED A LOT.  OVER SEVERAL MONTHS, THE ACCOUNT MADE MONEY.  I THEN RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM SOMEONE IDENTIFYING HIMSELF AS MR. DORSEY'S BUSINESS MANAGER AND THAT ALL TRADES WERE TO BE OK'D BY HIM.  I SAID I WOULD DO THAT AS SOON AS I RECEIVED A LETTER OF AUTHORIZATION FROM MR. DORSEY . THE TRADES IN DISPUTE WERE THOSE THAT OCCURRED FROM OUR PHONE CONVERSATION AND RECEIPT OF THE LETTER.  THOSE TRADES DID RESULT IN SOME LOSSES, BUT THE ACCOUNT WAS STILL PROFITABLE OVERALL.""
