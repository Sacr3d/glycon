  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I TOLD GWN SECURITIES EVERYTHING I KNEW, SHOWED THEM COPIES OF COMPLAINTS LETTERS, MY RESPONSES TO THOSE COMPLAINTS, ETC. THEY DECIDED THE COMPLAINTS WERE UNFOUNDED, FRIVOLOUS, WITHOUT MERIT.  LATER THEY, AND I, WERE INFORMED BY THE NASD THAT THERE WOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION. THEY DECIDED THEY DID NOT WANT TO WAIT FOR THE OUTCOME.  WHY THEY WERE SO SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT THE NASD ALSO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED (SEE COMMENTS LEFT BY JP TURNER & CO), I DO NOT KNOW.   THE NASD CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION. IN OCTOBER 2007 I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM FINRA, NO DISIPLINARY ACTION, NO FINES, NO FEES, NO YES ANSWERE ON MY U4!""
