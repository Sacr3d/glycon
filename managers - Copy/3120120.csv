JUST PRIOR TO MY TAKING OVER MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS AREA, SEVERAL BANK ACCOUNTS HAD TO BE RECONCILED AND BALANCED WITH CORRECTIONS BEING MADE. A SURPLUS OF FUNDS IN EXCESS OF $600,000 WAS MOVED TO CORPORATE ACCOUNTING.  DURING MY EMPLOYMENT AS MANAGER, MY STAFF DETERMINED THAT ONE ACCOUNT WAS STILL OUT OF BALANCE BY OVER $700,000.  WE WERE UNABLE TO RECONCILE THIS DIFFERENCE.  SENIOR MANAGEMENT WAS NOTIFIED, BUT A PARTICULAR FORM USED TO NOTIFY SENIOR MANAGEMENT WAS NOT COMPLETED. MANAGEMENT OF OUR NEW PARENT CORPORATION WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE SHORTFALL.  I WAS TERMINATED, BUT WAS NOT BLAMED FOR THE DEFICIT, WHICH ACTUALLY DEVELOPED PRIOR TO ME BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEPARTMENT.""
