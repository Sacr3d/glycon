THE CUSTOMER OPENED A NON-DISCRETIONARY BROKERAGE ACCOUNT WITH RULE AT THE FIRM. AT THAT TIME, THE CUSTOMER WAS SINGLE, 52 YEARS OLD, EARNED AN ANNUAL INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $30,000, HAD NO PRIOR INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE AND HAD NEVER PREVIOUSLY MAINTAINED A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, THE CUSTOMER RECEIVED A MONTHLY STIPEND OF $6,000 FROM HER MOTHER THAT WAS DEPOSITED INTO THE BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE FOR THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT WAS MODERATE GROWTH AND INCOME. RULE EXECUTED 245 TRADES ON 92 TRADING DAYS IN THE CUSTOMER'S BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. RULE CONTROLLED THE ACCOUNT AND THE FREQUENCY OF THE TRADING. THE TRADES TOTALED OVER $2.3 MILLION; THE PURCHASES TOTALED OVER $1.2 MILLION. RULE'S TRADING RESULTED IN CUSTOMER LOSSES OF $3,395, GROSS COMMISSIONS OF $51,024, A TURNOVER RATE OF 29.76 PERCENT, AND A COST-TO-EQUITY RATIO OF 126.80 PERCENT. THE TRADING ACTIVITY WAS UNSUITABLE GIVEN THE CUSTOMER'S FINANCIAL PROFILE AND INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE. MOREOVER, GIVEN THE CUSTOMER'S LACK OF INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE, SHE WAS UNABLE TO ASSESS THE MERITS OF THE TRADING ACTIVITY ENGAGED IN BY RULE. WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN CUSTOMER AUTHORIZATION, RULE EXERCISED DISCRETIONARY TRADING AUTHORITY IN THE BROKERAGE ACCOUNT OF THE CUSTOMER, WHO WAS NOT A MEMBER OF RULE'S FAMILY. WHILE THE CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGED BEING CONTACTED BY RULE ON A SPORADIC BASIS TO DISCUSS HIS GENERAL TRADING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE ACCOUNT, THE CUSTOMER ONLY BECAME AWARE OF THE TRADE DETAILS, AFTER THE FACT, UPON RECEIPT OF THE TRADE CONFIRMATIONS AND MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENTS. THE FIRM'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES PROHIBITED DISCRETIONARY TRADING IN BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OF ITS CUSTOMERS, UNLESS FOR A FAMILY MEMBER. THE FIRM REQUIRED ITS REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES TO COMPLETE COMPLIANCE QUESTIONNAIRES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. ON ONE OCCASION, RULE COMPLETED AND SIGNED A COMPLIANCE QUESTIONNAIRE IN WHICH HE REPRESENTED TO THE FIRM THAT HE HAD NOT EXERCISED DISCRETIONARY TRADING AUTHORITY OVER ANY CUSTOMER ACCOUNT. GIVEN THAT RULE EXERCISED TRADING DISCRETION IN THE CUSTOMER'S BROKERAGE ACCOUNT, HIS ANSWER WAS FALSE."",
