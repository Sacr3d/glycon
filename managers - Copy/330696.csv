  ""Allegations"" : ""IA RELEASE 40-3855; INVESTMENT COMPANY RELEASE 40-31078, JUNE 11, 2014: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 203(F) AND 203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940, AND SECTION 9(B) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 AGAINST THOMAS E. MEADE. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE INSTITUTION OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, MEADE HAS SUBMITTED AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT WHICH THE COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED TO ACCEPT. SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AND ANY OTHER PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION, OR TO WHICH THE COMMISSION IS A PARTY AND WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS HEREIN, EXCEPT AS TO THE COMMISSION'S JURISDICTION OVER HIM AND THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, WHICH ARE ADMITTED, MEADE CONSENTS TO THE ENTRY OF THIS ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 203(F) AND 203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940, AND SECTION 9(B) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER. THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT A FORMERLY REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISER FIRM, OF WHOM MEADE WAS THE PRESIDENT AND CCO, FAILED TO PREVENT, DETECT OR RESPOND TO INSIDER TRADING BY A FORMER VICE PRESIDENT. MEADE WAS AWARE OF THE UNIQUE RISKS FOR MISUSE OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION BY THE VICE PRESIDENT DUE TO MEADE'S PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT'S FATHER, WHO SERVED ON THE BOARD OF AT LEAST ONE PUBLIC COMPANY. YET, MEADE FAILED TO DESIGN THE FIRM'S WRITTEN COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN LIGHT OF THESE INSIDER TRADING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRM'S PARTICULAR OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, MEADE FAILED TO ADEQUATELY COLLECT AND REVIEW RECORDS OF PERSONAL TRADING BY THE FIRM EMPLOYEES. FURTHERMORE, MEADE FAILED TO MAINTAIN RESTRICTED OR WATCH LISTS OF STOCKS AS REQUIRED UNDER THE FIRM'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. EVEN AFTER LEARNING OF THE VICE PRESIDENT'S INSIDER TRADING, MEADE FAILED TO CONDUCT ANY INVESTIGATION OF THE TRADING AS REQUIRED BY THE FIRM'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OR DOCUMENT VIOLATIONS OF THE FIRM'S CODE OF ETHICS. LASTLY, AS CCO, MEADE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING THE FIRM'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, YET HE OVERLY RELIED ON EMPLOYEES TO SELF-REPORT VIOLATIONS AND FAILED TO ANNUALLY ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OR EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE IN PLACE. AS A RESULT OF THIS CONDUCT, THE FIRM WILLFULLY VIOLATED, AND MEADE WILLFULLY AIDED AND ABETTED AND CAUSED THE FIRM'S VIOLATIONS OF, SECTION 204A OF THE ADVISERS ACT AND RULE 204A-1 THEREUNDER; 204(A) OF THE ADVISERS ACT AND RULES 204-2(A)(12-13) THEREUNDER; AND SECTION 206(4) OF THE ADVISERS ACT AND RULE 206(4)-7 THEREUNDER. MEADE FAILED TO REASONABLY SUPERVISE THE VICE PRESIDENT WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 203(E)(6) OF THE ADVISERS ACT, WITH A VIEW TO PREVENTING VIOLATIONS OF THE ADVISERS ACT AND RULES THEREUNDER."",
