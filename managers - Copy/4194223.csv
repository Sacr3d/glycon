  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Mr. Campbell has advised us that he received a letter from the IRS regarding a lien during the Christmas holidays.  He is unclear on what led to any filing of a lien and has been trying to contact the IRS for an explanation.  Unfortunately, the IRS is apparently subject to the current shutdown of the federal government , and Mr. Campbell has not been able to speak to anyone at IRS who can explain why the lien may have been filed. Mr. Campbell believes that the filing of the lien was in error - he had been on a tax payment plan with the IRS, but they stopped taking payments after Hurricane Irma hit his area in Florida last year.  His tax accountant told him that the IRS was giving everyone in his geographic area a one-year reprieve in payments due to the hurricane. The IRS was supposed to re-start the regular withdrawals from his account again in November 2018, but instead sent him a tax lien in the mail just before Christmas. He has been trying to get to the bottom of this situation and to and find out where the mix-up happened but he was told he cannot get any answers until the government reopens.  He did not immediately amend his Form U4 because he believes the lien was the result of an error since he asserts that he was never late on a payment.  He plans to get in touch with the IRS as soon as the government shut down is over so that he can resolve the situation and see about having the lien rescinded.""
