The account was rebalanced to lock-in profits and reposition for anticipated market changes in accordance with investment objectives.  The client repeatedly cancelled portfolio review meetings, did not look at trade confirms or statements.  Nearly two full years after the rebalance, the client now is dissatisfied with having to pay taxes on the portfolio profits however is completely satisfied with portfolio performance.""
