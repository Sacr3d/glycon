  ""Allegations"" : ""CLIENT WROTE TO INSURANCE COMPANY TO COMPALAIN ABOUT POOR PERFORMANCE.  PURCHASED FOR APPROXIMATELY $20,000 (IN 2007), DECLINED TO LESS THAN $9,000 (IN 2009). REP AND CLIENT SPOKE, CLIENT WANTED MOVE TO FIXED ACCOUNT.  REP CALLED CLIENT IN 2010 TO REALLOCATE BACK TO MARKET BASED SUBACCOUNTS AND CLIENT NEVER RETURNED CALL GRANTING PERMISSION.  CLIENT STATES DID NOT AUTHORIZE SUBSEQUENT TRADES.  WE BELIEVE THAT IS BASED ON INSURANCE COMPANY LIQUIDATING ENOUGH FROM SUBACCOUNT TO PAY FOR INCOME RIDER CLIENT ORIGINALLY WANTED AND NEVER GAVE US PERMISSION TO CANCEL.  CLIENT HAS INCOME BASE GUARANTEE AMOUNT SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS ABOVE ORINAL INVESTMENT.  WE HAVE AGAIN ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT HER SEVERAL TIMES AND SHE HASN'T RETURNED OUR CALL.  THE AMOUNT INVESTED WAS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 10% OF HER INVESTED LIQUID NET WORTH AT TIME OF SALE."",
