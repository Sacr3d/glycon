  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Babyak consented to the sanction and to the entry of findings that he participated in private securities transactions involving customers of a member firm without first providing the firm written or oral notice of his activities. The findings stated that Babyak had the customers invest a total of $4,250,000 into a limited liability company (LLC) that he set up. Babyak was listed on the Certificate of Formation as the LLC's registered agent and authorized representative, obtained a tax identification number for the LLC, arranged for legal representation for the LLC, assisted in wiring funds from the firm's accounts to the borrower and the LLC's bank account, and signed the loan agreement and related security agreement on behalf of the LLC. He then caused the LLC to loan the $4.25 million to a third party for the benefit of his customers. The findings also stated that Babyak arranged for the LLC to use funds repaid from the $4.25 million loan to extend loans on behalf of the customers to two additional borrowers, with one borrower receiving a total of $1,045,862.40, and another a total of $984,804.22. Again, Babyak did not notify the firm that he was participating in these additional transactions."",
