THE ATTNY'S SAID THE PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS FRAUDULENTLY NAMED [THIRD PARTY] AS A DEFENDENT SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEFEATING DIVERSITY REMOVED. IN MAY 1982 I MET WITH [CUSTOMER] FOR A LIFE INSURANCE REVIEW OF HER POLICIES. SHE WAS A SINGLE SCHOOL TEACHER, SHE STATED SHE DIDNT LIKE THE FACT THAT HER (2) $5,000 ENDOWMENTS WOULD MATURE AT HER AGE 65, AND WOULD LOSE THE LIFE INSURANCE. SHE STATED SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE CONTINUED LIFE INS. PROTECTION RATHER THAN THE CASH AT AGE 65, AND WANTED HER NEPHEW, [FAMILY MEMBER] TO RECEIVE THOSE PROCEEDS. SHE WAS GIVEN A DETAILED ILLUSTRATION FROM PRUDENTIALS HOME OFFICE AS TO HOW HER NEW $25,000 FEN PAY W.C. POLICY COULD BE FUNDED BY PAYING 4 YEARS OF FULL PREMIUMS AND SHE COULD USE THE $8,000 PLUS IN LOAN VALUES TO PAY THE 4 ANNUAL PREMIUMS. THE (2) 5000 ENDOWMENTS WEE GOING TO MATURE ANYWAY IN 4 YEARS. THROUGH SYSTEMATIC LOANS AND HER AFTER TAX INTEREST PAYMENTS HER INS. PROSTANG WOULD CONTINUE. PER THE ILLUST. HER AFTER TAX PAYMENTS WOULD NOT EXCEED THE COMBINED ANNUAL PREMIUMS OF HER (2) 5,000 ENDOWMENTS OF $410.80. THIS WAS KNOWN AS A VARIABLE OUTLAY PLAN.""

SHE ALSO SET UP A $564,000 LIFE INSURANCE POLICY OUTSIDE HER ESTATE WITH HER SON [FAMILY MEMBER] AS OWNER AND BOTH OF HER SONS AS BENEFICIARIES TO PAY FUTURE ESTATE TAXES.  SHE DEPOSITED $20,000 IN THE FIRST YEAR SINCE SHE WANTED TO USE HER ANNUAL GIFTING ALLOWANCE OF (2X10,000) $20,000.""
