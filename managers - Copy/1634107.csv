  ""Broker Comment"" : ""PARK AVENUE SECURITIES REVIEWED THE ALLEGATIONS AND FOUND THEM TO BE MERITLESS.  CLAIMANTS [CUSTOMERS] APPROACHED ME ON THE INVESTMENT OPTIONS AT THE SUGGESTION AND REQUEST OF [CUSTOMER'S] MOTHER, [FAMILY MEMBER], ON APRIL 9, 2007.  IN ADDITION TO VARIABLE ANNUITIES, MULTIPLE INVESTMENT OPTIONS WERE IN FACT PRESENTED INCLUDING A LADDERED MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO, FIXED RATE ANNUITIES AND MANAGED PORTFOLIO ACCOUNTS.  DOCUMENTATION OF EACH WAS PROVIDED TO [CUSTOMER] AND [SPOUSE]. PROSPECTUSES WERE ALSO LEFT WITH THE CLIENTS.  THE [CUSTOMERS'] TIME LINE FOR THE USE OF THIS MONEY WAS EXTENSIVELY DISCUSSED WITH THREE FACE-TO-FACE TRIPS TO FLORIDA AND NUMEROUS PHONE CALLS.  THE MATERIAL WAS THOROUGHLY EXPLAINED AND COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT.  THEIR RESPECTIVE RISK TOLERANCE WAS DISCUSSED IN DETAILS AS IT RELATES TO THE ALLOCATION MODELS CHOSEN.  THE DEATH BENEFIT PROTECTION FOR EACH OTHER AND THEIR TWO SONS, AS IS THE FUTURE GUARANTEED INCOME STREAM WERE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE.  WHEN ASKED IF THESE SPECIFIC MONIES WOULD BE NEEDED IN THE SHORT TERM, THE ANSWER WAS \""NO.\""  AS FOR THE ESTATE PLANNING ASPECT, AS OF JULY 9, 2007, THE ESTATE ATTORNEY CHOSEN DIDN'T REALIZE [CUSTOMER] AND [SPOUSE] WERE INTESTATE.  IT WAS AT MY URGING AND SUGGESTION THAT THEY BEGIN THIS PROCESS, AS WELL.  [CUSTOMER] IS A SOPHISTICATED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE BUSINESSMAN WHO UNDERSTOOD, ALONG WITH HIS WIFE [SPOUSE], HOW THIS INVESTMENT FUNCTIONED.  IT WAS PURCHASED FOR THE UPSIDE (NON-GUARANTEED) POTENTIAL, THE DOWNSIDE PROTECTION FOR THE BENEFICIARIES, AND THE GUARANTEED LIFETIME INCOME STREAM IT WOULD EVENTUALLY PROVIDE THEM BOTH.  THE CLAIM WAS DENIED BY THE STATE OF FLORIDA INSURANCE DEPARTMENT FOR ALL THESE REASONS.  HAVING FAILED AT THE STATE LEVEL, THE [CUSTOMERS] FILED WITH FINRA A REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION AGAINST PARK AVENUE SECURITIES AND GUARDIAN INVESTOR SERVICES. I WAS A NON-PARTY WITNESS TO THE HEARING WHICH FOUND PARK AVENUE SECURITIES AND GUARDIAN INVESTOR SERVICES NEGLIGENT IN THE MATTER.""
