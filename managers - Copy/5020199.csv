  ""Broker Comment"" : ""As a result of the turmoil created by the recession in 2008 and the subsequent merger of Merrill Lynch with Bank of America, my position of Priority Banker was eliminated in 2009. My family's household income suffered substantially, not only as a result of my situation, but my partner's income was also impacted by economic conditions as well as having to simultaneously advocate for and manage our two adopted Romanian children and their special needs. We used credit cards to pay for Private School along with several other costly resources and services not provided for through traditional Public School resources. Shortly after the timing of this event I notified my Supervisor, whom I reported to at that time, and was advised that nothing was required to be updated on my U4.""
