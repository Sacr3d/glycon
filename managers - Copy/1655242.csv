  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CLAIM IS BELIEVED TO HAVE NO MERIT. THIS WAS A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY SALE, NOT A SECURITIES TRANSACTION. THE CLAIMANT PURCHASED FOR HIMSELF AND THREE FAMILY MEMBERS NON-REGISTERED FIXED INDEX UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES IN 2013, AND AT THE TIME OF THE SALE HE RECEIVED A POLICY ILLUSTRATION WHICH INCLUDED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CURRENT COSTS OF INSURANCE, AND THE GUARANTEED MAXIMUM COST OF INSURANCE. IN 2016, AFTER RECEIVING AN IN FORCE POLICY ILLUSTRATION WHICH INCLUDED THESE SAME VALUES, THE CLIENT INDICATED THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ILLUSTRATION DISCLOSED THAT THE POLICY COULD LAPSE BASED ON THE GUARANTEED MAXIMUM COSTS OF INSURANCE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE CLIENT COMPLAINED DIRECTLY TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND REQUESTED A RETURN OF THE INSURANCE PREMIUMS PAID INTO THE CONTRACT, AFTER HAVING HAD THE POLICIES FOR 2+ YEARS. CLAIMANT REFUSED TO MEET, DID NOT REPLY TO EMAILS NOR DID HE RETURN PHONE CALLS. INSURANCE COMPANY INVESTIGATED CLIENT ALLEGATIONS. RATHER THAN CONTEST THE CLIENT'S CLAIMS, THE INSURANCE COMPANY DECIDED TO REIMBURSE THE CLIENT A PORTION OF THE PREMIUMS PAID INTO THE CONTRACT. THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS NOT CONSULTED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY PRIOR TO MAKING THE DECISION TO REIMBURSE THE PREMIUMS NOR WAS THE REPRESENTATIVE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SETTLEMENT.""
