  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS CHARGED WITH \""INTERFERING WITH THE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANOTHER\"".  DURING MY JUNIOR YEAR OF COLLEGE, A FRIEND AND I WERE SHOPPING AT THE LOCAL CHRISTIANSBURG MALL.  I WAS ON MY CELL PHONE WHILE IN THE STORE AND SET A GARMENT DOWN ON MY BAG.  I WAS STILL INSIDE THE STORE AND THE SALES PERSON VIEWED THIS AS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY.  THIS STORE HAD A POLICY FOR PROSECUTING ALL CONCEALMENT OF MERCHANDISE, WHETHER IT WAS INTENTIONAL OR NOT.  I HAD NO DESIRE OF EVER STEALING ANYTHING FROM THAT STORE, AND THE GARMENT WAS WORTH LESS THAN $15 DOLLARS.  HOWEVER, I STILL HAD TO GO TO COURT WHERE I PLEAD \""NOT GUILTY\"".  THE CHARGE WAS TAKEN UNDER ADVISEMENT AND DISMISSED AFTER SIX MONTHS, AND MY LAWYER TOLD ME THAT THIS WOULD ALLOW ME TO KEEP A CLEAN CRIMINAL RECORD.  I GRADUATED FROM VIRGINIA TECH IN THE CFP PROGRAM, AND IT HAS BEEN A DREAM OF MINE TO WORK AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER AND TO HELP FAMILIES.  I AM NOT A DISHONEST PERSON AND I HOPE THAT THIS WILL NOT DETER ME FROM ENTERING THIS FIELD.""
