  ""Broker Comment"" : ""FROM THE OPENING OF THIS ACCOUNT IN 1996 THROUGH 2000, [CUSTOMER] ENJOYED EXTRAORDINARY GAINS WHILE THE MARKETS INCREASED BUT THEN REFUSED REPEATED AND DOCUMENTED RECOMMENDATIONS, BOTH VERBAL AND WRITTEN, TO REDUCE THEIR PORTFOLIO RISK.  EVEN THE BRANCH MANAGER SPOKE WITH THE [CUSTOMERS], WHO INSISTED TO HER THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD AND WISHED TO MAINTAIN THEIR AGGRESSIVE STANCE.  HOWEVER, DISAPPOINTED BY SUBSEQUENT LOSSES, THE CLIENTS DECIDED TO SEEK TO REGAIN THE PROFITS THEY HAD MADE DURING THE LATE-NINETIES SUCCESS STREAK OF THE MARKET BY FILING A COMPLAINT.  THE WEEK BEFORE THE SCHEDULED ARBITRATION, PRUDENTIAL WAS CONTACTED BY THE CLIENT'S ATTORNEY SEEKING SETTLEMENT OPTIONS.  RATHER THAN INCURRING THE HIGHER EXPENSE OF ARBITRATION, PRUDENTIAL AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT, AND BOTH PRUDENTIAL AND THE [CUSTOMERS] DISMISSED ME FROM THE CASE WITHOUT FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION OR FURTHER INVOLVMENT FROM ME.""
