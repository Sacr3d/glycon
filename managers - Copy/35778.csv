  ""Broker Comment"" : ""U4 DISCLOSES NASD COMPLAINT #C-234 FILED 7/20/81. THE RESPONDENTS, PAINE WEBBER JACKSON & CURTIS, JOHN J. BURKE, JR., REGISTERED PRINCIPAL, AND ROBIN KASER, REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE, CONSENTED TO THE ORDER SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE RESPECT OF THE MATTERS SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT AND NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY OTHER PROCEEDING ACTION, AND WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE COMPLAINT. BURKE PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT REGARDING THE NASD COMPLAINT: \""THROUGH A ROUTINE EXAMINATION BY THE NASD A COMPLAINT WAS FILED AGAINST PAINE WEBBER JACKSON & CURTIS, INC., JOHN J. BURKE, REGISTERED PRINCIPAL, AND ROBIN T. KASER, REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE. THE NASD ALLEGED THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE, ROBIN KASER RECOMMENDED AND EFFECTED TRADING ACTIVITY IN MUNICIPAL UNIT INVESTMENT TRUSTS WHICH WERE ALLEGEDLY EXCESSIVE IN SIZE AND CONTRARY TO INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES OF THE CLIENT. THE NASD ALSO ALLEGED THAT I FAILED TO PROPERLY SUPERVISE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. AS A BRANCH MANAGER, I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE TRADING PATTERN IN THE ACCOUNT OF THE CLIENT, MR. WILLIAM ZACHARIAS. AT VARIOUS TIMES I DISCUSSED WITH THE CLIENT, MR. ZACHARIAS, AND ALSO MR. KASER, THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE, THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND RATIONALE BEHIND THE TRANSACTIONS IN QUESTION. AT NO TIME DID THE CLIENT EVER INDICATE TO ME HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE WITH THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY AS AGREED BETWEEN HE AND ROBIN KASER. AS BRANCH MANAGER, I MADE A CONTINUAL REVIEW OF THE ACCOUNT IN QUESTION AND ALSO COMMUNICATED WITH THE CLIENT IN WRITING SPECIFICALLY ADVISING THE CLIENT OF UNUSUAL TRANSACTIONAL COSTS INVOLVED WITH HIS INVESTMENT STRATEGY. THE CLIENT CONTINUED HIS OWN INVESTMENT STRATEGY EVEN AFTER OUR WRITTEN COMMUNICATION. I KNEW THE CLIENT, MR. ZACHARIAS, TO BE AN EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT AND SOPHISTICATED BUSINESSMAN OF LONG STANDING REPUTATION IN THE COMMUNI*See FAQ #1*""
