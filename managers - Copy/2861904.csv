  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I MET WITH CUSTOMERS TO ESTABLISH A REGULAR ACCOUNT AND DESIGN A PORTFOLIO FOR GROWTH AND INCOME THAT WOULD BE SUITABLE BASED ON THEIR RISK TOLERENCES AND OBJECTIVES. APPROXIMATELY 2-3 MONTHS AFTER OPENING UP THEIR ACCOUNT, THE CUSTOMER'S ASKED ME TO TRANSFER IN THEIR IRA'S FROM AN OUTSIDE FIRM.  WHEN THE IRA'S TRANSFERRED, WE MET TO DO AN ACCOUNT REVIEW.  A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF CUSTOMER'S IRA WAS INVESTED IN MUNDER NET NET B SHARES WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED AT ANOTHER FIRM BY ANOTHER REP. WITHIN THE PERVIOUS TWO YRS. CUSTOMER WAS CONCERNED THAT THE VALUE HAD DECLINED AND WANTED MY ADVICE.  I REVIEWED THE FUND EXPLAINING THAT AS A SECTOR FUND IT WAS AGRESSIVE AND THEY SHOULD EXPECT VOLATILITY. WE THEN LOOKED AT OTHER OPTIONS WITHIN THE MUNDER FAMILY.  CUSTOMER TOLD ME SHE DID NOT WANT TO MAKE ANY CHANGES UNTILL THE FUND REACHED ITS PRIOR VALUE.""
