  ""Allegations"" : ""Harrington was named a respondent in a FINRA complaint alleging that he converted customer funds by intentionally and without authorization taking and exercising ownership over $19,874.64 belonging to one of his customers when he neither owned the property nor was entitled to possess it. The complaint alleges that Harrington engaged in a series of private securities transactions with at least two individuals through which he sold over 300,000 shares of restricted stock he had purportedly received as compensation from a company for approximately $276,000. Harrington failed to provide his member firm with prior written notice of his private securities transactions, including his proposed role as seller in the transactions. The complaint also alleges that Harrington lied to his firm when he mischaracterized the purpose of payments received into his bank accounts. Specifically, Harrington falsely characterized three payments received from one of the individuals for the purchase of the stock as vacation-rental-by-owner (VRBO) income. Harrington also falsely characterized the $100,000 payment he received from the other individual for the purchase of stock as a payment from his former broker-dealer. In addition, Harrington knowingly caused at least two falsified VRBO rental contracts to be sent to his firm in order to conceal the true purpose of funds he had received in private securities transactions. The complaint further alleges that as FINRA began investigating him, Harrington continued to actively conceal his misconduct with the knowing assistance of his assistant. Specifically, at Harrington's direction or with his knowledge and consent, his assistant altered certain bank statements requested by FINRA in order to conceal the originator of a payment Harrington received for the stock. Harrington, by and through his attorney, submitted the altered bank statement to FINRA as if it were an authentic, non-altered document. In addition, during his investigative testimony, Harrington falsely and repeatedly insisted that the fake VRBO agreements he had created were authentic and represented legitimate rental transactions. Additionally, Harrington submitted to FINRA a written response which falsely stated that he was entitled to the approximately $20,000 he took from the customer, as payment for investment advisory services rendered to her. In addition, the complaint alleges that after he learned that FINRA was investigating his conversion of the customer's funds, Harrington contacted the customer and attempted to have her sign a false document stating that he was entitled to the money he stole."",

  ""Regulator Statement"" : ""Extended Hearing Panel Decision Rendered November 12, 2018. The sanctions are based on the findings that Harrington converted customer funds, intentionally causing the customer to wire $19,874.64 of her funds into his account. The findings stated that Harrington took the funds for his own use, without the customer's authorization, and never returned them. Harrington attempted to obstruct FINRA's investigation into his conversion by contacting the customer and asking her to sign a false document stating that she had stayed at his vacation rental property. The findings also stated that Harrington engaged in private securities transactions, which he was compensated for, without giving prior notice to or receiving prior written approval from, his member firm. Harrington sold private securities transactions that were outside the regular scope or course of his employment to at least two individuals. Harrington did not sell the securities through his firm and it did not supervise the sales. Further, Harrington was compensated for charging approximately $276,000 in sales to two purchasers. The findings also included that Harrington provided false documents to his firm in connection with its investigation into whether he had engaged in outside business activities. Harrington intentionally misrepresented the nature of payments he received and deposited into his bank accounts as rental income and a payment from his former broker dealer. In fact, the payments were for the purchase of stock in Harrington's outside business. Harrington knowingly caused falsified rental contracts to be sent to his firm in order to conceal the true purpose of the funds he had received. FINRA found that Harrington also provided false and misleading documents and information to FINRA in connection with its investigation of the private securities transactions and the conversion. Harrington produced a bank statement to FINRA that his sales assistant, under his direction, altered to remove a customer's name as the originator of a wire transfer. Harrington also submitted a written response to FINRA that falsely represented he was entitled to the funds he directed the customer to wire to him claiming it was payment for investment advisory fees rendered to the customer. Harrington also falsely testified that the purported rental agreements with another customer were authentic and represented legitimate rental transactions. The decision became final on December 31, 2018."",
