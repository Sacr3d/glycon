  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ACCOUNT NOTES DOCUMENT DISCUSSIONS BEGINNING IN DECEMBER, 2011, REGARDING THE LARGE ONGOING WITHDRAWALS FROM THE SUNAMERICA ANNUITY CONTRACT. THE ADVISOR PROJECTED THE ANNUITY WOULD BE DEPLETED IN 8 TO 12 YEARS BASED ON THE RATE OF WITHDRAWAL. THIS ISSUE WAS DISCUSSED AGAIN DURING AN APPOINTMENT IN THE OFFICE ON MARCH 12, 2012. THE ADVISOR RECOMMENDED A STRATEGY THAT WOULD GUARANTEE A PORTION OF THE CLIENT'S INCOME FOR LIFE, PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR FUTURE INCREASE IN INCOME AND NET APPROXIMATELY THE SAME INCOME WITH LESS TAXATION. THIS INCLUDED THE TRANSFER FROM SUNAMERICA TO THE LINCOLN ANNUITY WITH THE I4LIFE GUARANTEED INCOME RIDER, AND A MUTUAL FUNDS PORTFOLIO TO SUPPLEMENT THE GUARANTEED INCOME. ON MARCH 15, PAPERWORK WAS SIGNED, AND ON APRIL 5 THE CONTRACT WAS DELIVERED. THE $1,500 WITHDRAWAL FROM THE SUNAMERICA CONTRACT WAS NOT GUARANTEED, AND WAS DEPLETING THE VALUE OF THE SUNAMERICA ANNUITY.  IF THE WITHDRAWALS DO NOT EXCEED THE PROVISIONS STIPULATED IN THE CONTRACT, THE INCOME WILL BE GUARANTEED FOR LIFETIME, REGARDLESS OF THE CONTRACT VALUE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LINCOLN INCOME GUARANTEED AMOUNT AND THE TOTAL PREVIOUS WITHDRAWAL OF $1,500, IS DRAWN FROM THE NON-QUALIFIED MUTUAL FUNDS, WHICH DECREASES THE TAXABLE INCOME. THE CLIENT WAS ENCOURAGED TO CONSIDER SCHEDULING AN APPOINTMENT TO REVIEW THE DETAILS OF THE PORTFOLIO STRATEGY AND ACCOUNT OBJECTIVES.""
