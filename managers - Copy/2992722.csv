  ""Initiated By"" : ""UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""The Securities and Exchange Commission (the \""SEC\"") files this Complaint against Defendants Victor Lee Farias (\""Farias\"") and Integrity Aviation & Leasing, LLC (\""IAL\"") (collectively \""Defendants\""), and alleges that from 2013 through January 2019, Farias and his company, IAL, defrauded investors-many of whom were retired San Antonio Police Department officers or first responders-out of more than $14 million through a fraudulent investment scheme involving the offer and sale of purportedly secured promissory notes. Defendants represented to investors that their money would be used by IAL to purchase aircraft engines and other aviation assets that would be leased or sold to major airlines and that revenues derived from this business would be used to pay investors interest on their investments at the rate of 10-12% per year. Farias and IAL also represented that the promissory notes, which were issued by IAL, were secured by IAL's assets.   In fact, Farias and IAL misrepresented many facets of the offering, misspent a significant portion of the investors' funds, and used only a small portion of the investor funds for their intended purpose. Specifically, Farias and IAL used approximately $6.5 million of the $14 million raised to pay investors Ponzi-like returns, invested approximately $2.7 million in a friend's gas station and convenience store project, and paid nearly $1 million in undisclosed and impermissible sales commissions to IAL's sales staff for their successful efforts in recruiting investors to purchase IAL's promissory notes. Furthermore, Farias misappropriated $2.4 million of investor funds for his own personal use, including disbursements for meals, entertainment, auto expenses, retail purchases, travel, apartment rent, jewelry and other luxury retail purchase, and golf and country club expenses.   Additionally, despite representing that the promissory notes would be secured by IAL's assets, neither Farias nor IAL took any steps to file the necessary documents to secure the investors' interests. Even worse, they omitted to inform investors that Farias had already pledged IAL's assets as collateral in a separate deal to benefit a separate company that Farias owned.   As new investor funds dried up, Farias deceived at least one investor with the lie that he was taking IAL public in an initial public offering, so he could repay all investors, and that he was working with the SEC on the offering. To support that lie, he sent a carefully cropped photo of the SEC's investigative subpoena to that investor, as proof of his communications with the SEC, and blamed the SEC for the alleged delays in the IPO process.   Through their actions, Defendants have violated and, unless enjoined, will continue to violate the antifraud and securities-registration provisions of the federal securities laws, specifically Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\""Securities Act\"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\""Exchange Act\"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder."",
