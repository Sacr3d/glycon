  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MY ATTORNEY IS INVESTIGATING THE MATTER TO DETERMINE WHY A JUDGMENT WAS GIVEN WITHOUT PROPER SERVICE.  I FOUND NO RECROD OF A JUDGMENT ON EXPERIAN AFTER MY BROKER/DEALER NOTIFIED ME.  HOWEVER, WHEN ORDERING ALL THREE CREDIT BUREAUS I FOUND IT ON TRANS UNION.  I HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY ENGAGED COUNSEL AND HAVE FOUND IT IN THE VIRGINIA DISTRICT COURT SYSTEM.  MR. MOORE OWNS/OWNED THE YORK HAVEN MARINA.  THIS MUST GO BACK TO A BOAT THAT I OWNED THAT WAS KEPT THERE OVER SIX YEARS AGO.""
