FINDINGS OF THE EXAMINATION DATED 8/3/2009, WHICH WAS ACTUALLY 16 MONTHS AFTER THE TRADE, ALLEGED THAT FUNDS FOR THE INVESTMENT WERE NOT USED AS DESCRIBED IN THE OFFERING MATERIAL AND INSTEAD WERE USED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PAYMENT OF DAILY OPERATIONS EXPENSES AND PAYING OFF EXISTING DEBTS. WAS NOT A SALES PRACTICE VIOLATION. CLIENT MAILED A LETTER WITHDRAWING COMPLAINT AFTER LOOKING FURTHER INTO HIS RESEARCH ON THE MATTER.""
