  ""Allegations"" : ""ON JULY 29, 2003, AN ATTORNEY REPRESENTING [CUSTOMER] INFORMED WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY, L.L.C. THAT HIS CLIENT HAD INSTRUCTED HIM TO INITIATE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE FIRM AND ITS FORMER REPRESENTATIVE, ROSS BAUMGARTEN. ACCORDING TO THE ATTORNEY, [CUSTOMER] INTENDED TO ALLEGE THAT ROSS BAUMGARTEN HAD RECOMMENDED UNSUITABLE SECURITIES TO HER FROM 1999 TO OCT. 2002, AND THAT AS A RESULT, SHE HAD LOST MORE THAN $50,000. (ROSS BAUMGARTEN LEFT WILLIAM BLAIR IN AUG. 2002 TO JOIN ANOTHER FIRM. [CUSTOMER] TRANSFERRED HER ACCOUNT TO THAT FIRM AT THE TIME OF HIS DEPARTURE). ACCORDING TO THE ATTORNEY, UNLESS WILLIAM BLAIR CONTACT HIM TO RESOLVE THE MATTER, HE WAS PREPARED TO FILE AN ARBITRATION CLAIM. WILLIAM BLAIR DECLINED HIS OFFER. IN AUG. 2003, WILLIAM BLAIR REVIEWED [CUSTOMER'S] ALLEGATIONS AND THE ACTIVITY IN HER VARIOUS ACCOUNTS FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE FIRST ACCOUNT IN 1991 THROUGH SEPT. 2002, WHEN [CUSTOMER]TRANSFERRED HER ACCOUNT TO ROSS BAUMGARTEN'S NEW EMPLOYER. THE FIRM CONCLUDED THAT THE TRADING IN THE 1999 TO 2002 TIME PERIOD REFERENCED BY HER ATTORNEY WAS SUITABLE FOR [CUSTOMER]. WILLIAM BLAIR CONTACTED ROSS BAUMGARTEN, WHO DISPUTED [CUSTOMER'S] ALLEGATIONS AND PROVIDED INFORMATION REFUTING HER CLAIMS THAT CERTAIN TRADES HAD BEEN UNSUITABLE. THE LOSSES IN [CUSTOMER'S] ACCOUNT WERE LARGELY RELATED TO ONE SECURITY THAT HAD NOT BEEN RECOMMENDED BY ROSS BAUMGARTEN. ON AUG. 20, 2003, [CUSTOMER'S] ATTORNEY AGAIN TELEPHONED WILLIAM BLAIR TO DISCUSS [CUSTOMER'S] PROPOSED ARBITRATION CLAIM. ACCORDING TO THE ATTORNEY, [CUSTOMER] PREFERRED TO RESOLVE HER DISPUTE WITHOUT FILING THE ARBITRATION CLAIM AND WAS WILLING TO ACCEPT $15,600 TO SETTLE THE MATTER. WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY DISCUSSED THE PROPOSAL WITH MR. BAUMGARTEN AND AGREED TO SETTLE THE MATTER BECAUSE THE COST TO DEFEND AN ARBITRATION CLAIM WAS DEEMED TO BE MORE THAN $15,000. ROSS BAUMGARTEN AGREED TO PAY HALF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE MATTER WAS RESOLVED ON SEPT. 29, 2003."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CLIENT MAINTAINED AN ACCOUNT WITH ME FOR MORE THAN 12 YEARS, INVESTING PRIMARILY IN IPO'S AND GROWTH STOCKS. WHEN I LEFT WM. BLAIR & CO. TO GO TO ANOTHER FIRM, SHE TRANSFERRED HER ACCOUNT TO MY NEW FIRM WITHOUT MENTIONING ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE SUITABILITY OF HER INVESTMENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, SHE WOULD INSIST THAT SHE WANTED HIGHER RETURNS IN HER ACCOUNT. SHE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THAT HIGHER RETURNS INVOLVED HIGHER RISK. WHEN HER STOCKS WERE PREFORMING WELL, SHE NEVER COMPLAINED ABOUT SUITABILITY. WHEN HER POSITIONS DECLINED IN THE 2000-2002 TIMEFRAME, SHE DECIDED THAT THE INVESTMENTS WERE UNSUITABLE. THE CLIENT'S LARGEST POSITION WAS IN A PENNY STOCK THAT SHE ACQUIRED DIRECTLY FROM THE COMPANY. I DID NOT RECOMMEND THE STOCK, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE LOSSES IN HER ACCOUNT. THE CLIENT'S COMPLAINT WOULD HAVE COST MORE TO DEFEND THAT SHE WAS WILLING TO ACCEPT IN A SETTLEMENT, SO I AGREED TO SETTLE THE MATTER ON A NUISANCE BASIS. I DID NOT MISHANDLE THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNT IN ANY WAY.""
