I DIDN'T ADMIT TO THAT-I ADMITTED TO A TIME DELAY BETWEEN HIS VERBAL INSTRUCTIONS AND MY ENTERING THE ORDERS NEXT MORNING. HE RESIDED IN  JAPAN.

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""TERMINATION. I PURSUED A CIVIL CASE OF SEXUAL HARRASSMENT AND SEXUAL DISCRIMNATION AGAINST MERRILL. THE SUIT WAS SETTLED 12/1997. THE MASD INVESTIGATED THE CLAIMS MERRILL MADE AGAINST ME AT MY REQUEST AND FOUND THEM TO BE WITHOUT MERIT. I DO NOT AGREE THAT THE TRADES WERE UNAUTHORIZED. RATHER, OUT OF SELLER'S REMORSE, THE CLIENT RENEGED ONE MONTH AFTER THE FACT-CONVENIENTLY AFTER THE STOCK HAD RISEN ANOTHER 15 POINTS. I WAS ASKED BY MY CLIENT TO CONFIRM IN WRITING THE EVENING OF JULY 12TH THAT THE TRADE WAS BUSTED. THIS WAS AFTER 8 PM-NOTE THE 13 HOUR TIME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HERE AND JAPAN. THE FAX ONLY STATED THAT THE TRADES WERE BUSTED. TEHRE WAS NO ONE IN THE OFFICE TO REVIEW THIS NOTE(I SEARCHED THE OFFICE-THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE THERE) SO I DON'T AGREE WITH THE GENERAL STATEMENT \""ADMITTED TO SENDING CLIENT CORRESPONDENCE...: IT DOSEN'T REPRESENT THE SITUATION CLEARLY. STATE IS CORRECT""
