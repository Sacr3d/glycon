  ""Broker Comment"" : ""UNFORTUNATELY WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND IN COLLEGE I WENT ON VACATION WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS.  BEING 20 YEARS OLD I WAS VERY NAVE AND STUPID.  BEFORE WE LEFT WE HAD FAKE IDS MADE AND THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT TIME.  GOING TO A BAR IN VIRGINIA BEACH, WE WERE CAUGHT AS TO OUR AGE.  I WAS INTOXICATED AND WHEN THE POLICE OFFICE ASKED ME FOR ID, I GAVE HIM THE WRONG ONE.  BECAUSE WE WERE SO YOUNG, HE HIT US WITH EVERYTHING POSSIBLE.  I HAVE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE IN MY PAST AND HAVE LEARNED GREATLY FROM IT.  NOTHING HAS HAPPENED SINCE THAT PARTICULAR INCIDENT AND IT NEVER WILL AGAIN.  INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PLEA MY WAY OUT OF IT I TOOK FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS AND ACCEPTED ALL CHARGES AND PAID ALL FINES.""
