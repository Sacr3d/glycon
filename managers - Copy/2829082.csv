  ""Firm Name"" : ""Alpha Cubed Investments, LLC"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Violation of firm policy and procedures."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Alpha Cubed Investments, LLC filed a Form U5 after Mr. Sixt resigned stating that he was discharged while under investigation of violating firm policies and procedures, specifically the Firm's personal trading policy.    Although Mr. Sixt voiced his disagreement with the policy that was to be adopted after he resigned, he has attempted to follow the firm's proposed policy while he was considering if he could live with it.  Mr. Sixt is convinced that he met the intent, if not the letter, of the proposed policy and has not received information about the supposed violation(s), and is under the impression that it is a ploy of Alpha Cubed to discredit him.""
