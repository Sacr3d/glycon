ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2000, PRICE ARRANGED A $1,012,500 SALE OF MERCHANDISE TO LOGIC, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 9% OF CAIS'S REPORTED REVENUE FOR THE QUARTER. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SALE, PRICE ENTERED INTO AN ORAL SIDE AGREEMENT WITH LOGIC, WHICH ALLOWED IT TO RETURN THE MERCHANDISE IF CAIS DID NOT MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN LOGIC WITHIN 60 DAYS. PRICE KNEW THAT LOGIC COULD NOT PAY FOR THE MERCHANDISE WITHOUT THE INVESTMENT FROM CAIS. "",
