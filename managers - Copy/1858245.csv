  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Apparently a former client of mine, alleged that the variable annuities which purchased in April 2015 and additional securities purchased throughout 2015 were not suitable. Furthermore, no specific compensatory damages were alleged. As you may very well know, I left MetLife in July of 2015 and was prohibited from taking my client files, so I am working strictly on memory here. She was always a good client and we had a decent working relationship, but I had recently brought in a coworker to act as a money manager for the portfolio since I was transitioning my business on life insurance production.  So whatever complaints she may have are probably directed towards my coworker.  All of the annuity, mutual fund and BDC business was absolutely appropriate for her and MetLife compliance approved the business as such.""

Mrs. Cutrer said that I never informed her of the fact that this is a product designed to pay her a predictable and sustainable income throughout her retirement. Furthermore, she had sufficient dollars invested in other conservative no load mutual funds which she could access for liquidty concerns. Both AXA Equitable and MetLife investigated her claims and summarily declined her request""
