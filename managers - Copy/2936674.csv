  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I SET UP A  PDA ACCOUNT WITH [CUSTOMER] ON 12/30/13 BECAUSE HE STATED THE WANTED CONTROL OF ASSETS SO HE WANTED TO MOVE THEM OUT OF THE GROUP.  IN ADDITION, WE ADDED GPA ADVICE ON THE ACCOUNT AS INDICATED ON THE ACCOUNT FOR THE MANAGED ADVICE FOR THE CLIENTS AT OR NEAR RETIREMENT.  I EXPLAIN ALL THE FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH ACCOUNT PLUS THE SURRENDER CHARGES BECAUSE HE HAD A SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PLAN ON THE ACCOUNT THAT WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY THE SURRENDER CHARGES,  IN ADDITION, THE PDA PACKAGE IS ALWAYS LEFT BEHIND WHICH INCLUDES THE PD PROSPECTUS.  I DID RECEIVE A CALL IN LATE FEBRUARY WHICH I DID NOT RETURN SINCE I WAS ATTENDING MY SERIES 7 CLASS IN SANTA ANA CA.  HOWEVER, I [CUSTOMER] CONTACTED ME AGAIN AROUND 3/14/2014 IN WHICH I RETURNED HIS CALL IN 5 MINUTES.  DURING OUR CONVERSATION HE ASK TO REMOVE THE PDA ADVICE SINCE HE WANTED TO MANAGED HIS OWN ACCOUNT IN WHICH IT WAS REMOVED IMMEDIATELY.  [CUSTOMER] NEVER MENTIONED HE WANTED TO ROLLOVER ANY OF ASSETS TO AN OUTSIDE AGENCY DURING ANY OF OUR APPOINTMENTS TO INCLUDE ALL THE HOME VISITS IN THE YEAR OF 2012.  IN THAT CASE I WOULD HAVE NEVER WOULD HAVE SUGGESTED AND ROLLOVER IRA WITH VALIC HE HAS ALWAYS MENTIONED WE WANTED TO CONTROL ASSETS AS FAR AS INVESTMENT CHOICES.  HE NEVER MADE STATED TO ME HE WANTED TO CONTROL HIS ASSETS OUTSIDE OF THE VALIC PLATFORM.  HE WAS MADE AWARE THAT WE WERE CONDUCTED A ROLLOVER IRA FROM THE GROUP TO HIS IRA SO HE CAN HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OF HIS ASSETS WITH TAXATION AND NO PLAN ADMINISTRATOR CONTROL.   I DID SPEAK WITH [CUSTOMER] LAST WEEK HE STATED, \""HE MADE IT WAS A COMMUNICATION ERROR BECAUSE HE NEVER STATED THAT WANTED TO MOVE HIS ASSETS TO AN OUTSIDE PLAN.\""  HE RECENTLY HAS TAKEN SOME INVESTMENTS COURSE AND NOW FEELS HE CAN BEAT THE VALIC RETURNS WITH OTHER INVESTMENTS WITH THE NEW ORGANIZATION HE IS PART OF.  SORRY ABOUT THE DELAYED RESPONSE I WAS OUT OF THE OFFICE TAKING MY SERIES 7 EXAM SO I TOOK THE WEEK OF THE STUDY.     DURING ALL OF OUR APPOINTMENTS HE NEVER STATED HE WANTED TO MOVE HIS ASSETS OUT OF THE VALIC PLAN.  THEREFORE, WE ROLLED HIS ASSETS INTO HIS IRA WITH FULL DISCLOSURE.  I SPOKE WITH [CUSTOMER] AFTER HE FILLED THE COMPLAINT AND HE STATED THAT HE DID NOT COMMUNICATE CLEARLY WHAT HE WANTED TO DO WITH ASSETS DURING OUR CONVERSATION AFTER THE COMPLAINT.  I THINK AFTER HE GOT INVOLVED WITH THIS INVESTMENT GROUP HE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART BECAUSE HE STATED HE COULD GET A BETTER RETURN WITH THE KNOWLEDGE HE RECEIVED FROM THE INVESTMENT GROUP.""
