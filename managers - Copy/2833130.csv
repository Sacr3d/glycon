  ""Allegations"" : ""NASD RULES 2110, 3310: AT ALL TIMES RELEVANT TO THIS MATTER, MARASCO WAS A MARKET MAKER WITH HIS MEMBER FIRM IN THE HEALTH CARE AND BIOTECH SECTOR. MARASCO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENTERING ORDERS, EXECUTING TRADES, AND DETERMINING THE QUOTATIONS AT WHICH HIS FIRM WOULD BUY AND SELL SECURITIES IN THE HEALTH CARE AND BIOTECH SECTOR IN APPROXIMATELY 132 SECURITIES. MARASCO ENTERED ORDERS INTO HIS FIRM'S ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORM; IT CONNECTS TO ALL MARKET DATA SOURCES AND ORDER ENTRY SYSTEMS. THE ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORM ALLOWS USERS TO ENTER ORDERS AND EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS ACROSS ALL AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCLUDING NASDAQ, LISTED EXCHANGES, AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS. IN MARCH AND APRIL 2005, MARASCO ENTERED BUY AND SELL ORDERS IN 132 SEPARATE SECURITIES INTO THE FIRM'S ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORM. MARASCO ENTERED AN ORDER INTO THE ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORM AND CONTEMPORANEOUSLY ENTERED ANOTHER ORDER ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MARKET FOR APPROXIMATELY THE SAME NUMBER OF SHARES INTO THE ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORM. MARASCO ENTERED BUY AND SELL ORDERS INTO THE ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORM WHICH EXECUTED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER RESULTING IN 7,464 SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS. THIS RESULTED IN NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS BEING EXECUTED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER CREATING BONA-FIDE MARKET ACTIVITY IN THE SECURITIES. EACH OF THESE SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS WAS PUBLICLY REPORTED TO NASDAQ THROUGH THE AUTOMATED CONFIRMATION TRANSACTION SERVICE AND DISSEMINATED TO THE PUBLIC. MARASCO'S FIRM ADVERTISES TRADING VOLUME IN ORDER TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ATTRACT CUSTOMER ORDER FLOW USING TWO PRIVATE SERVICE PROVIDERS. THESE SERVICE PROVIDERS ALLOW BROKER-DEALERS TO ADVERTISE INTRA-DAY AND HISTORICAL TRADING VOLUME. ADVERTISED TRADE VOLUME IS USED BY THE TWO PRIVATE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO COMPILE RANKINGS AND PUBLISH REPORTS THAT RANK BROKER-DEALERS BY SECURITY. IN MARCH AND APRIL 2005, MARASCO'S ADVERTISED TRADING VOLUME FROM ENTERING ORDERS THAT EXECUTED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 90 PERCENT OF HIS FIRM'S ADVERTISED TRADING VOLUME IN 32 SEPARATE SECURITIES AND MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE FIRM'S ADVERTISED TRADING VOLUME IN 100 SEPARATE SECURITIES. MARASCO OVERSTATED HIS TRADING VOLUME IN 132 SEPARATE SECURITIES AND CAUSED TO BE PUBLISHED OR CIRCULATED, REPORTS OF PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS WHEN EACH SUCH PURCHASE OR SALE TRANSACTION WAS NOT A BONA FIDE PURCHASE OR SALE OF SUCH SECURITY."",
