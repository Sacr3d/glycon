  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Claimant held the mutual fund positions directly on a transfer agent system and not on a brokerage account system with a cash component.  Claimant misunderstands the difference in the process of liquidating mutual fund positions held on a transfer agent system and a brokerage account system.  Claimant, initially, did not provide the proper instructions for redemption and Medallion Signature Guarantees as explained in the respective mutual fund prospectuses.  Additionally, Mr. Chatterton believed at the end of the initial conversation that there was an understanding with Claimant for him to follow up with Claimant in one week.  Mr. Chatterton was not named as a Respondent in the arbitration.""
