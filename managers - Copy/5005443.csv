  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS A LICENSED PERSONAL BANKER AT WELLS FARGO. A BANK TELLER MUST SEND MANY CREDIT CARD APPLICATION REQUESTS TO A PERSONAL BANKER TO MEET QUOTA. THEY ARE TO GET THE CLIENTS FULL AUTHORIZATION BEFORE SENDING THE APPLICATION REQUEST TO THE PERSONAL BANKER. I WAS SENT A PRE-PAID CREDIT CARD APPLICATION REQUEST AND SUBMITTED IT AS TRAINED TO DO SO. AFTER I SUBMITTED THE PRE-PAID CREDIT CARD APPLICATION, THE COUPLE IN QUESTION CLAIMED THEY HAD ONLY WANTED INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRE-PAID CREDIT CARD AND DID NOT WANT THEIR APPLICATION SUBMITTED. THEY ALSO STATED THEY HAD MADE IT CLEAR TO THE BANK TELLER WHO SENT ME THE APPLICATION REQUEST. AS A RESULT OF A CO-WORKERS INEPT DECISION, AND IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID A TERMINATION, I RESIGNED FROM MY POSITION AT THE BANK. THIS WAS A PRE-PAID CREDIT CARD APPLICATION ONLY, NOT AN INVESTMENT, SECURITIES, OR ANY INTEREST BEARING PRODUCT. IT REQUIRES NO LICENSE UNDER FINRA. I WAS IN A NON COMMISSIONED POSITION AT THE BANK. I COULD NOT RECEIVE ANY COMMISSION OR FINANCIAL GAIN BY SUBMITTING THIS APPLICATION.""
