  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In 2008 I placed the home for sale as housing market was declining. I kept the home on & cont'd to make payments.  BofA began raising rates on the loan when rates & home prices were declining.  They refused as the value of the home was less than owed. I also learned whether I refinanced with BofA or any lender there was a $10k prepayment penalty within 5 yrs of original loan.  In 2011 when BofA raised the rate again,a real estate agent helped me negotiate the short sale.""
