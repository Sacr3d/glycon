  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC RELEASES 33-9481, 34-70908, IA RELEASE 40-3720, INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 RELEASE 30802, NOVEMBER 20, 2013: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION DEEMED IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE INSTITUTED AGAINST GREGORY J. ADAMS (\""ADAMS\""). THE DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT ALLEGES THAT: A PRINCIPAL MANAGER WAS THE FOUNDER, MANAGING PARTNER, AND SOLE OWNER OF AN INVESTMENT ADVISER REGISTERED WITH THE SEC UNTIL OCTOBER 2008, WHEN HE SOLD THE ADVISER, ALONG WITH RELATED ENTITIES, TO A NEW OWNER, GREGORY J. ADAMS. THE ADVISER AND THE PREVIOUS OWNER TARGETED RETIREES SEEKING TO INVEST THEIR MONEY OFFSHORE, AND MOST OF THE ADVISER'S CLIENTS WERE RETIRED INDIVIDUALS WITH SELF-DIRECTED IRAS. IN THE INVESTMENT ADVISER'S PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS, THE PREVIOUS OWNER REPRESENTED TO CLIENTS THAT THE INVESTMENT ADVISER \""USE[D] AN EXTENSIVE INVESTMENT SELECTION PROCESS THAT [WAS] NOT ONLY QUALITATIVE BUT INCORPORATE[D] A SIGNIFICANT DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS AS WELL.\"" IN FACT, THE INVESTMENT ADVISER, THE PREVIOUS OWNER, AND LATER ADAMS ADVISED THEIR CLIENTS TO INVEST ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN FUNDS AND ACCOUNTS MANAGED OR CONTROLLED BY AN INDIVIDUAL, REGARDLESS OF THEIR CLIENTS' INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. THE INDIVIDUAL IS NOT REGISTERED WITH THE COMMISSION IN ANY CAPACITY, OFFERS MANAGED ACCOUNT SERVICES THROUGH A WEALTH MANAGEMENT COMPANY, AND WAS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN A FRAUD ACTION THE COMMISSION FILED. SPECIFICALLY, THE PREVIOUS OWNER RECOMMENDED TO THE INVESTMENT ADVISER CLIENTS THAT THEY INVEST ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN SEVERAL OF THIS INDIVIDUAL'S OFFSHORE FUNDS. ADAMS MADE MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS OF FACTS TO INVESTORS CONCERNING THE REFERRAL AND CONSULTING AGREEMENTS, ABOUT COMPENSATION TO THE INVESTMENT ADVISER. WHILE ADAMS WAS CONTROL PERSON OF HIS INVESTMENT ADVISER, ADAMS MISREPRESENTED COMPENSATION HE RECEIVED FROM THE INDIVIDUAL'S RELATED ENTITIES (THE FUNDS) AND THUS FAILED TO ADEQUATELY DISCLOSE HIS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST TO THE INVESTMENT ADVISER'S CLIENTS. DURING ADAMS' OWNERSHIP OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISER, IT MADE MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS, AND MISLEADING DISCLOSURES ABOUT COMPENSATION. ADAMS MISLED CLIENTS TO INVEST IN HEDGE FUNDS. ADAMS MADE MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS REGARDING INTERESTS SWAP, INVOLVING THE INDIVIDUAL'S ENTITIES. BEFORE THE SUSPENSIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S FUNDS AND THE SWAP AGREEMENT, ADAMS FAILED ADEQUATELY TO RESEARCH OR INVESTIGATE A NUMBER OF RED FLAGS ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL AND HIS FUNDS. ADAMS ALSO FAILED INDEPENDENTLY TO INVESTIGATE A HEDGE FUND EVEN AFTER THE FUND'S PRINCIPAL, THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL, SUSPENDED REDEMPTIONS OF ITS CLASS A AND SUBSEQUENTLY REFUSED TO FILE A CLAIM IN RECOVERY PROCEEDINGS OR PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING ITS LOSSES. AS A RESULT OF THE CONDUCT, ADAMS WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 17(A) OF THE SECURITIES ACT, SECTION 15(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, AND SECTIONS 206(1), 206(2) AND 206(3) OF THE ADVISERS ACT. WILLFULLY AIDED AND ABETTED AND CAUSED VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 206(4) AND RULE 206(4)-2, AND RULE 204-3 OF THE ADVISERS ACT; AND WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 207 OF THE ADVISERS ACT.
