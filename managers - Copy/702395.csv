  ""Broker Comment"" : ""SETTLED FOR $20,000 .00. THE FIRM PAID THE FULL AMOUNT. IN RESPONSE TO [CUSTOMER] OBJECTIVES & DESIRES. I INITIATED A VARIETY OF TRADES IN THE ACCT., GENNERALLY MOVING THE CUSTOMER OUT OF COMMON STOCKS & INTO ADD'L BONDS & MUTUAL FUNDS. WHEN THE PRICE OF THE BOND INCREASED DRAMATICALLY TOWARDS THE END OF 1981, I ACTED WITH THE CUSTOMER'S APPROVAL & CONTINUED TO LIQUIDATE THE BONDS & PURCHASE OTHER SECURITIES. THESE CONSISTED OF CERTAIN AGGRESSIVE GROWTH STOCKS FOR THE CUSTOMER'S ACCT. IN AN EFFORT TO SATISFY HER EXPRESSED DESIRE FOR GREATER PRICE APPRECIATION. [CUSTOMER], ACTING IN CONERT WITH HER SON-IN-LAW, SUBSEQUENTLY COMPLAINED THAT THE TRANSACTIONS WERE UNSUITABLE FOR [CUSTOMER'S] NEEDS AND THAT THE TRADE VIOLED HER STATED OBJECTIVE OF GROWTH. THIS SETTLEMENT WAS INITIATED & COMPLETED BY MANAGEMENT W/O CONSULTING WITH ME. I HAD TAKEN ANOTHER MANAGEMENT POSITION WITH THE FIRM & RELOCATED TO THE MID-WEST.""
