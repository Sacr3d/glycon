  ""Allegations"" : ""MSRB RULES G-17, G-30(A) - DAVID SIRIANNI CHARGED EXCESSIVE MARKUPS IN MUNICIPAL SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND THAT RESTITUTION IN THE AMOUNT OF $231,257 IS OWED. THE MARKUPS IN THE TRANSACTIONS RANGED FROM 5.01% TO 15.57% AND WERE NOT DISCLOSED TO HIS MEMBER FIRM'S CUSTOMERS. IN SOME OF THE TRANSACTIONS, THE MARKUPS EXCEEDED 9.4%. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS, THE STAFF DETERMINED THAT SIRIANNI, BY NOT DISCLOSING TO THE CUSTOMERS THE EXCESSIVE MARKUPS CHARGED, ENGAGED IN TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE IN CONTRAVENTION OF SECTION 17(A)(2) AND (A)(3) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. IN THE TRANSACTIONS, SIRIANNI FOLLOWED THE SAME PATTERN OF CONDUCT. HE PURCHASED MUNICIPAL SECURITIES FROM A BROKER-DEALER ON BEHALF OF HIS FIRM, HELD THE BONDS IN INVENTORY FOR AT LEAST OVERNIGHT, AND THEN MADE THE BONDS AVAILABLE FOR RESALE AT AN EXCESSIVE MARKUP TO FIRM CUSTOMERS. SIRIANNI ALONE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE PRICES PAID BY FIRM CUSTOMERS. SIRIANNI ENGAGED IN THIS CONDUCT DESPITE THE FACT THAT HIS FIRM HAD A POLICY THAT PROHIBITED MARKUPS IN EXCESS OF 3% ABSENT EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES. BY HOLDING THE BONDS OVERNIGHT BEFORE MAKING THEM AVAILABLE FOR RESALE, THE FIRM'S SUPERVISORY SYSTEM, WHICH ONLY REVIEWED INTRA-DAY TRANSACTIONS FOR THE FAIRNESS OF MARKUPS/MARKDOWNS IN MUNICIPAL SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS, DID NOT CAPTURE THESE TRANSACTIONS. IN THESE TRANSACTIONS, SIRIANNI CAUSED HIS FIRM TO SELL MUNICIPAL SECURITIES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT TO A CUSTOMER AT AN AGGREGATE PRICE (INCLUDING ANY MARKDOWN OR MARKUP) THAT WAS NOT FAIR AND REASONABLE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ALL RELEVANT FACTORS, INCLUDING THE BEST JUDGMENT OF THE BROKER, DEALER OR MUNICIPAL SECURITIES DEALER AS TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION AND OF ANY SECURITIES EXCHANGED OR TRADED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION, THE EXPENSE INVOLVED IN EFFECTING THE TRANSACTION, THE FACT THAT THE BROKER, DEALER, OR MUNICIPAL SECURITIES DEALER IS ENTITLED TO A PROFIT, AND THE TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION. IN THESE TRANSACTIONS, SIRIANNI ACTED IN CONTRAVENTION OF SECTION 17(A)(2) AND (A)(3) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND THUS VIOLATED MSRB RULE G-17. SECTION 17(A)(2) MAKES IT UNLAWFUL FOR ANY PERSON IN THE OFFER OR SALE OF ANY SECURITIES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO OBTAIN MONEY OR PROPERTY BY MEANS OF ANY UNTRUE STATEMENT OF A MATERIAL FACT OR ANY OMISSION TO STATE A MATERIAL FACT NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MAKE THE STATEMENTS MADE, IN LIGHT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THEY WERE MADE, NOT MISLEADING; AND SECTION 17(A)(3) MAKES IT UNLAWFUL FOR ANY PERSON IN THE OFFER OR SALE OF ANY SECURITIES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO ENGAGE IN ANY TRANSACTION, PRACTICE, OR COURSE OF BUSINESS WHICH OPERATES OR WOULD OPERATE AS A FRAUD OR DECEIT UPON THE PURCHASER."",
