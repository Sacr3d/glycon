  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Military notified me of moving from NE to CA in April of 2012. I placed my home on the market in May 2012. We had to report to my new base in CA by June 2012. After two months on the market, a buyer presented GMAC Mortgage an offer and they accepted closed in August 2012. We had to short sale as we were not able to afford a mortgage payment in NE as well as rent in CA. Our home was not able to be rented out for the amount of the mortgage payment and we did not have sufficient funds to take monthly losses while renting it.""
