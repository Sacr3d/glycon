  ""Allegations"" : ""The Securities and Exchange Commission (\""Commission\"") deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\""Exchange Act\"") against Richard Barone (\""Respondent\"").  The Commission finds that Dominic Tropiano engaged in unauthorized and unsuitable trading in leveraged exchange traded funds (\""ETFs\"") in the accounts of customers of America Northcoast Securities, Inc. (\""ANS\""). From May 2015 through April 2016, ANS did not register Tropiano as a registered representative with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\""FINRA\""). However, ANS permitted Tropiano to solicit and place securities trades in 66 accounts of retail customers that Tropiano had recruited from the broker-dealer where he previously worked and with whom he had a one year non-compete agreement. Respondent was the Chairman and majority indirect owner of ANS and was Dominic Tropiano's father-in-law at the time. Respondent permitted him to open customer accounts and permitted him to place trades in ANS customer accounts even after learning of customer complaints. Accordingly, Respondent caused ANS to violate Section 15(b)(7) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b7-1 thereunder."",
