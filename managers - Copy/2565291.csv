THE CLIENT HAD EXPRESSED TO HIM ON SERVERAL OCCASIONS THE URGENCY TO IMMEDIATELY LIQUIDATE HER SHARES OF PAC TEL.  HOWEVER, THE CLIENT WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND HE HAD NO WAY OF GETTTING THE DOCUMENT TO HER FOR A SIGNATURE.

HOWEVER, KNOWING HIS ERROR IN JUDGEMENT AND WANTING TO PROTECT THE FIRMS' GOOD NAME, HE NOTIFIED HIS MANAGER OF WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED.""
