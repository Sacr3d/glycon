  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON 7/13/2001, I WAS IMPLICATED IN AN INVESTIGATION BY THE LOCAL POLICE THAT CONCERNED THE ALLEGED THEFT OF PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM MY BRANCH MANAGER, MR. TODD SIMONSEN.  ON 7/16/2001, I WAS ADVISED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS INC (AEFA) THAT, DUE TO THE INVESTIGATION, THEY WERE PLACING ME ON SUSPENSION AS PERMITTED BY MY FRANCHISE AGREEMENT.  MY ACCUSER WAS ADAMANT THAT CHARGES WERE BROUGHT AGAINST ME,  AND I WAS NOT ASKED BY AEFA FOR MY ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT, OR GIVING A CHANCE TO RESPOND BEFORE THE SUSPENSION WAS ISSUED.  I WAS INNOCENT OF THE CHARGES AND CHOSE TO PLEA NOT GUILTY AND FIGHT THE CHARGES.  THE LEGAL PROCESS WAS DRAWN OUT, AND LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD LAST WELL BEYOND 90 DAYS.  AS A RESULT, AEFA CHOSE TO EXERCISE THEIR DISCRETIONARY RIGHT UNDER THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT, AND TERMINATED MY FRANCHISE (DEFAULT OF FRANCHISE AGREEMENT.)  WHEN I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO ADDRESS THE CHARGES AT A PRETRIAL HEARING, SWORN TESTIMONY BY A THIRD PARTY SHOWED THAT THE \""EVIDENCE\"" PROVIDED TO THE POLICE BY MY ACCUSER WAS INCOMPLETE, ERRONEOUS AND MISLEADING.  THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFERED A CHANGE IN THE CHARGE TO A CLASS B MISDEMEANOR DISORDERLY CONDUCT.  SINCE MY FRANCHISE WAS ALREADY TERMINATED AND THE COST TO TAKE IT TO FULL TRIAL WAS EXCXESSIVE, I MADE AN ALFORD PLEA AS PERMITTED BY WISCONSIN LAW.  AEFA INITIALLY INDICATED THAT MY TERMINATION WAS WITHOUT FAULT, BUT LATER, WITHOUT NOTIFICATION TO ME, CHANGED THAT NOTICE.  I DISAGREE WITH AEFA'S AMENDED BASIS FOR MY TERMINATION.""
