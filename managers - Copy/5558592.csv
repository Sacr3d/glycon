  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Suzanne Giacometti, Mutual Fund Specialist at SFVPMC sent me this note in response to the complaint.Hi Mike,  Thank you so much for your comments.  I did speak to [Redacted] late yesterday.  She is livid to say the least and places all blame on you for saying she could withdraw tax/penalty free.  She also believes you processed the request, so I corrected her and let her know she made a phone request and was informed of the potential tax consequence.   I tried to calm her and ask step by step questions about her tax filing.  Yes, she does her own taxes.  I asked if she reported the 1099-R.  It appears she did not based on her understanding it wasn't taxable.  I told her she still has to report it and she has to provide proof that she only removed contributions and not earnings.  Otherwise the IRS will consider it fully taxable.  She is accepting no blame and no responsibility.  I directed her to consult with a tax professional and assume she will find the situation is much better than she thinks.  There is one tax feature she mentioned that took place prior to coming to SF, and that movement of funds might be causing as issue.  I will review further.""
