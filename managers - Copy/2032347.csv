  ""Broker Comment"" : ""DURING THE SUMMER OF 1988, EARLY ONE MORNING, MY FRIENDS AND I WERE COMING HOME AND WE FOUND A STREET SIGN LYING DOWN ON THE GROUND. SOMEONE HAD TAKEN IT OUT OF ITS HOLE, BUT LEFT IT LYING ON THE GROUND. WE DECIDED TO PICK IT UP AND TAKE IT HOME WITH US.  ONE THE WAY HOME, A POLICE CAR APPROACHED AND EVERYONE DROPPED THE SIGN, EXCEPT ME.  I WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH MISDEMENOR THEFT. TWO WEEKS LATER, I PLED GUILTY AND PAID A FINE.""
