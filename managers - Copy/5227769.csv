  ""Allegations"" : ""JUSTIN PLANTE WAS UNDER INTERNAL REVIEW FOR INPUTTING INACCURATE ACTIVITY FOR COMPENSATION PURPOSES."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""As part of my duties as an Internal Wholesaler at AIG SunAmerica, I was required to speak with and assist financial advisors with their variable annuity business on a daily basis.  When speaking with the advisors, I was required to log my activity into the company database which was used to determine our level of activity on the sales desk.  I was questioned one day by AIG SunAmerica because I entered multiple activities under one financial advisors name, because I had spoken to that financial advisor multiple times that day.  AIG SunAmerica felt that I was overstating my activity, while I maintained that logging multiple activities under that advisor was warranted because I spoke to him so many times and had spent so much time in assisting him.  No conclusion was ever reached one way or the other because I made the voluntary decision to leave to AIG.""
