  ""Allegations"" : ""THE CUSTOMER WAS A CLIENT I HAD WITH NATIONWIDE.  HE HAD A TERM POLICY AND WAS INTERESTED IN CONVERTING IT TO A PERMANENT POLICY.  HE WAS A SELF EMPLOYED BUSINESS OWNER INTERESTED IN THE MARKET. I SHOWED THE CUSTOMER A UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICY AND A VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE POLICY.  HE DECIDED TO CONVERT TO A VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE.   AFTER HAVING HIS VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICY FOR APPROXIMATELY A YEAR, THE CUSTOMER DECIDED HE NEEDED ADDITIONAL INSURANCE.  HE VERY MUCH LIKED WHAT THE VARIABLE POLICY OFFERED.  HE ALSO FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS GOING TO RECEIVE AN ANNUAL INHERITANCE FROM A FAMILY MEMBER.  HE DECIDED TO START AN ADDITIONAL NEW VUL AT THAT TIME (HE WISHED TO KEEP THE TWO POLICIES SEPARATE).   HE PLANNED TO OVER FUND THIS NEW POLICY.  SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER THE CUSTOMER BEGAN HIS NEW POLICY I RESIGNED FROM NATIONWIDE.  HE APPARENTLY WAS UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS.  SOMEONE IN THE NATIONWIDE OFFICE SUGGESTED IF HE WAS UNHAPPY THEN HE SHOULD FILE A COMPLAINT.  I DID NOT FIND OUT ABOUT ANY OF THIS UNTIL CONSIDERABLY LATER.  I SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND OUT THAT THE CUSTOMER'S INHERITANCE CEASED AFTER THE FIRST YEAR.  I WAS UNABLE TO CONTACT THE CUSTOMER DUE TO NATIONWIDE'S STRICT NON-COMPETE CLAUSE."",
