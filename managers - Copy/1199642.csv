  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I am making monthly payments to the IRS as agreed.  There are no other obligations concerning this tax lien.  I have paid my taxes until 2012 when I was terminated from my employment as a general agent with an insurance company,  I did not receive my bonus that year which would have paid my taxes, I started a new job based on commissions only.  A tax settlement firm worked on my case until this year.  We agreed to a monthly amount and have made timely payments ever since.""
