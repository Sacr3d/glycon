  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS CHARGE WAS MADE IN ERROR AS INDICATED IN DISMISSAL/ CHARGE UPDATE DOCUMENT.  THE DOCUMENT STATES THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WOULD NOT ACCEPT THIS CASE SINCE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF BREAKING THE LAW OR CRIMINAL INTENT.     DURING THE TIME OF THE EVENT IN QUESTION, I WAS ASSISTING LEGACY SUPPLY COMPANY, A FAMILY OWNED BUSINESS THAT I HAD BEEN INVOLVED WITH ON A PART-TIME BASIS.  IT WAS AN INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY COMPANY.   THE CHARGE WAS DUE TO MY POSSESSION OF A SUBSTANCE CALLED POTASSIUM CHLORATE.  THIS IS A CHEMICAL THAT IS FULLY LEGAL TO OWN & A COMPONENT USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE COMMON TABLE MATCH AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS.  APPARENTLY, THIS CHEMICAL CAN ALSO BE USED TO CREATE PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES.  AFTER A FULL INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED IT WAS DETERMINED THAT MY OWNERSHIP OF POTASSIUM CHLORATE WAS FOR LEGITIMATE BUSINESS PURPOSES ONLY - AND THE CHARGE WAS FULLY DISMISSED.""
