I DO KNOW THAT THE CONTACT PERIOD WITH THIS CLIENT WAS DURING 2000 AND THE WE MET ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, AS THEY WERE ALREADY CLIENTS OF AMSOUTH'S.  WITHOUT A FILE OR CLIENT INFORMATION I CANNOT BE CERTAIN OF SPECIFIC DATES OR TRANSACTIONS.  I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE ALLEGATION UNTIL JULY 18, 2001, WELL AFTER THE SETTLEMENT DATE AND DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE THE ALLEGATION.  I DO NO BELIEVE THAT IF A FIRM DECIDES TO SETTLE AN ALLEGATION OF THIS NATURE, WITHOUT CONTACTING THE INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIVE, THEN ANY REPERCUSSIONS SHOULD FALL ON THE FIRM.  I WAS NOT ASKED FOR ANY COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AT ANY TIME, AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS REMOVED FROM MY RECORD."",
