  ""Allegations"" : ""The client specifically complained about the lack of growth in his account and requested a high growth strategy. Client profile confirmed suitability. RR and client discussed a high growth strategy and client acknowledged his understanding and approval. Unfortunately, the timing of the strategy shift coincided with a large drop in the market which led to a decline in the accounts value.  The loss precipitated a written complaint proclaiming he informed the representative that he wanted his account managed conservatively. An internal investigation was conducted in conjunction with counsel. It was concluded that there was no evidence of any breach of regulatory duty or obligation on the part of the representative or the firm. The client was informed of the firms investigative conclusion and told the firm would not offer a settlement. The representative felt a responsibility for the performance and offered a viable solution via a possible private settlement permissible under securities law providing the firm granted permission and filed proper disclosures. The firm granted permission, Representative made a private offer and the client accepted."",
