  ""Firm Name"" : ""CUNA Brokerage Services, Inc."",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Representative was terminated for admittedly signing client signatures on distribution forms."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The referenced disclosure event that was recorded on 2/21/18 occurred in 12/16 and it related to RMD withdrawal forms.  I was new to retail production, looked on line and read that it was legal to sign and initial for a client with their express permission for this request. My goal was effect a 2016 Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) that had to be faxed to my firm fifteen days before the end of the year to ensure timely compliance with the distribution and avoid client penalty's.     Being new to retail services, RMD processing, RMD calculations and RMD paperwork, I made an error in judgment that doing this with the client's express permission, was the best thing to do.  In this case while processing over 80 distributions correctly (with wet client signature ink) I did not consider faxing the document to the out of town client.     I acknowledge and accept responsibility for my errors.  I have learned from the experience and have suffered greatly due to my firm's choosing to never discuss their rational for terminating my employment or not even taking the time to ask me about the events that led to these actions or why and how the events occurred.     Having been registered since 1981, I have never had to process RMD's as my work was more institutional in nature and I wanted to make sure the client did not face 50% penalty's for missing a year end deadline in my first year RMD processing.     In December of 2017 all of my RMD forms were submitted correctly, I started a month earlier than the previous year and it is peculiar that as I made my error a year ago and my error was discovered when comparing 2016 and 2017 withdrawal forms.  In thirty years of actual registration and thirty-seven years of very complex paperwork and client management this is my first and only offence.     I apologize for my error, I take it seriously, I have read the FINRA regulations and the client was not harmed in any manner.""
