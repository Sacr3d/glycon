  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON 2/2/2000 AT 9:30PM I WAS WALKING FORM A BAR TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE TO GET A RIDE HOME, BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK I SHOULD DRIVE. AS I WALKED THROUGH A PARK A POLICE OFFICER APPROACHED ME ON A BICYCLE. HE ORDERED ME TO PUT THE BEER DOWN AND GIVE HIM MY LICENSE. I DID AND HE IMMEDIATLY PLACED ME UNDER ARREST AND HADNCUFFED ME. I TRIED TO ASK WHAT I WAS UNDER ARREST FOR AND HE WAS VERY RUDE AND VAGUE. HE EVENTUALLY SAID OPEN CONTAINER. I WAS STANDING NEXT TO THE BOTTLE AND HE TOLD ME TO STEP AWAY FROM IT. WHEN I TRIED TO WALK AWAY AS HE INSTRUCTED, I KNOCKED THE BOTTLE OVER WITH MY FOOT. HE THEN GRABBED ME AND THREW ME TO THE GROUND. HE JUMPED ON MY BACK AND PUT HIS KNEE IN MY NECK AND SAID NOW I WAS UNDER ARREST FOR FELONY DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENCE. HE THEN TOOK ME TO JAIL. ON 2/22/2000 I WAS CHARGED WITH TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE FOR ACCIDENTALLY KNOCKING OVER THE BOTTLE WITH MY FOOT. ON 7/11/2000 A CHARGE ON RESISTING WITHOUT VIOLENCE WAS ADDED AFTER 2 POSTPONEMENTS. ON 7/19/2000 I PLED GUILTY TO RESISTING WITHOUT VIOLENCE AND CHARGE OF TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE WAS DROPPED. ""
