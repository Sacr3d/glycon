  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I have not resided in the State of Iowa since 1987 and was unaware of this lien until FINRA recently brought it to my attention.  Based on discussions with Iowa department of revenue staff, it appears that the lien relates to taxes on the sale of property in 2006 that was part of the estate of my father, who died in 2005.  I served as executor of my father's estate and my sister and I were the beneficiaries.  I have not yet received a copy of the lien or ascertained the exact amount due. As soon as I receive this information, I plan to pay off the lien and then apply for whatever refund I might be entitled to.""
