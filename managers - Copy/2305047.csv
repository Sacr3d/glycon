  ""Allegations"" : ""IA Release 40-4269; Investment Company Release 40-31903, November 17, 2015: The SEC deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 against Thomas A. Kolbe. In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer of Settlement which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission's jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order. On the basis of this Order and Respondent's Offer, the Commission finds that these proceedings arise out of Respondent's violation of a Commission order entered on August 30, 2004 in Advisers Act Release No. 2288 (the \""Commission Order\""), which, among other things, barred Respondent from association with any investment adviser with a right to reapply for association after one year from the date of the Commission Order. Respondent violated the Commission Order by associating, without reapplying to the Commission for association, with three different investment advisers at various time between 2006 and 2013. As a result of this conduct, Respondent willfully violated Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act."",

  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC ADMINISTRATIVE IA RELEASE 40-2288 AND INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT RELEASE 40-26588, AUGUST 30, 2004:  THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\""COMMISSION\"") DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 203(F) AND 203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 (\""ADVISERS ACT\"") AND SECTION 9(B) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 (INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT\"") AGAINST THOMAS A. KOLBE (\""RESPONDENT\"" OR \""KOLBE\"").  THE SEC ALLEGED THAT KOLBE WILLFULLY AIDED AND ABETTED AND CAUSED A FIRM'S (THE \""FIRM\"") VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 206(1) AND (2) OF THE ADVISERS ACT. DURING THE RELEVANT TIME PERIOD, KOLBE WAS THE FIRM'S NATIONAL SALES MANAGER. IN THAT ROLE, KOLBE DIRECTLY SUPERVISED THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY'S \""MARKET TIMING DESK,\"" WHO WAS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICING THE FUNDS TO IDENTIFY MARKET TIMING OR FREQUENT TRADING ACTIVITIES AND FOR NEGOTIATING THE COMPANY'S AGREEMENTS WITH MARKET TIMERS. BECAUSE THE HEAD OF THE FIRM'S MARKET TIMING DESK REPORTED DIRECTLY TO KOLBE, HE REGULARLY AND CONSISTENTLY INFORMED KOLBE OF THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS THE FIRM ENTERED INTO WITH MARKET TIMERS. KOLBE FURTHER KNEW THAT THE FIRM ONLY NEGOTIATED THE MARKET TIMING AGREEMENTS ORALLY OR THROUGH EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS AND NEVER DOCUMENTED THE AGREEMENTS FORMALLY IN WRITING.  KOLBE ALSO KNEW THAT WITH ALL MARKET TIMERS, THE FIRM REQUIRED THAT THEY KEEP THEIR TIMED MONIES WITHIN THE A FUND COMPLEX WHEN EXCHANGING OUT OF A FUND APPROVED FOR TIMING. WITH SOME MARKET TIMERS, KOLBE ALSO KNEW OF THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT THAT THEY MAINTAIN STICKY ASSETS WITHIN THE FUND COMPLEX IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN FREQUENT TRADING.  WITHOUT DUE REGARD FOR THE POTENTIAL DETRIMENTAL IMPACT OF FREQUENT TRADING BY THE MARKET TIMERS, KOLBE PERMITTED THE HEAD OF THE FIRM'S MARKET TIMING DESK TO NEGOTIATE MARKET TIMING AGREEMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM AND TO REQUIRE STICKY ASSETS AS PART OF THOSE AGREEMENTS, BECAUSE, AS THE NATIONAL SALES MANAGER OF THE FIRM, KOLBE'S PRIMARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO INCREASE THE FIRM'S ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. KOLBE KNEW, OR WAS RECKLESS IN NOT KNOWING, THAT THE ASSETS BROUGHT TO THE FUNDS UNDER THE MARKET TIMING AGREEMENTS, WHILE SERVING TO INCREASE THE FIRM'S ADVISORY FEES, COULD BE TRADED IN A MANNER DETRIMENTAL TO THE FUNDS.  THIS PLACED THE FIRM IN A CONFLICT OF INTEREST SITUATION WITH THE FUNDS THAT WAS NOT DISCLOSED TO THE FUNDS' BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR SHAREHOLDERS AND THROUGH WHICH THE FIRM BREACHED ITS FIDUCIARY DUTY TO THE FUNDS. DURING THE SAME PERIOD THAT FIRM ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH MARKET TIMERS, THE PROSPECTUSES FOR THE FUNDS REPRESENTED THAT THE FIRM DISCOURAGED FREQUENT TRADING BY INVESTORS BY ATTEMPTING TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF EXCHANGES A SHAREHOLDER COULD MAKE IN EACH FUND. THE FIRM ALSO INCLUDED THE PROSPECTUSES IN REGISTRATION STATEMENTS FOR THE FUNDS FILED WITH THE COMMISSION. KOLBE KNEW, OR WAS RECKLESS IN NOT KNOWING, THAT THE FIRM'S AGREEMENTS WITH MARKET TIMERS WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE FUNDS' PROSPECTUS DISCLOSURE AND WERE DETRIMENTAL TO THE FUNDS."",
