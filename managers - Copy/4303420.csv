By their own admission, the initial purchases of the ETF (2013-2015) resulted in net positive returns. The damages claimed do not take into account any such profits made from these investments or any profits from any other investments made in the relevant accounts. Further, they seek in damages not only a return of all alleged losses without counting related gains; they also add to that compounded interest.  In the interest of avoiding fees and costs associated with litigation, complaint was settled. Settlement should not be deemed to be an admission of any kind, whether of liability or of wrongdoing, by the representative.""
