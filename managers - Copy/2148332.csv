  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS 17 IN 1968.  WORKING 2ND SHIFT AT FABRIC PLANT.  I LEFT WORK AT THE END OF MY SHIFT.  UPON ENTERING THE PARKING LOT, I NOTICED A PERSON CHANGING A TIRE WHEN HE CALLED ME OVER FOR HELP.  HE ASKED ME TO HOLD A FLASHLIGHT SO I DID. APPROXIMATELY 5-10 MINUTES LATER PEOPLE FROM INSIDE THE PLANT RAN OUT TO US ACCUSING US OF TAKING HUB CAPS.  AS IT TURNED OUT THE PERSON I WAS HELPING WAS IN FACT TAKING THE HUB CAPS.  THE THIEF WOULD NOT CONFIRM MY INNOCENCE. SO, I WAS CHARGED WITH LARCENY, 1 COUNT A MISDEMEANOR, $30.00 COURT COST AND 12 MONTH PROBATION.""
