  ""Broker Comment"" : ""UPON RELOCATING FROM NEW YORK TO FLORIDA, I WAS CONVINCED TO PURCHASE MULTIPLE INVESTMENT PROPERTIES IN THE BOOMING FLORIDA HOUSING MARKET BY AN OVERZELOUS REAL ESTATE AGENT WHO WAS PRACTICALLY GUARANTEEING ME THAT THE VALUES WOULD CONTINUE TO RISE.  AS IT WAS WIDELY REPORTED THE BANKS WERE LENDING WITH RECKLESS ABANDON TO ENABLE CONSUMERS TO MASSIVELY OVEREXTEND.  SINCE THE BUBBLE BURST, THESE PROPERTIES LOST ANYWHERE FROM 50 TO 90% OF THEIR VALUES,  MAKING IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE HOLDING ON WITH A MASSIVELY NEGATIVE CASH FLOW.  I WAS FACED WITH BEING IN A HOLE THAT I WOULD NEVER EMERGE FROM, TAKE THE AGENT AND POSSIBLY THE MORTGAGE COMPANIES TO COURT, OR LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE IN PERPETUAL UNANSWERED DEBT.  SINCE I BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MY OWN ACTIONS, I DECIDED NOT TO LITIGATE.  INSTEAD, I DECIDED TO FILE CHAPTER 7 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHERS HAVE FOR IDENTICAL REASONS.  ACCEPTING THE BLIGHT ON MY RECORD OF THIS BANKRUPTCY, BUT ALLOWING ME TO REBUILD MY CREDIT AND FINANCIAL LIFE.""
