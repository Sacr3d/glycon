  ""Allegations"" : ""In June 2015 customer rolled over funds from his employer retirement accounts with the Firm to an IRA also with the Firm. Customer alleges that representative advised that doing so would not prevent customer from participating in employer's plan in the future. Customer says rollover has prevented this and is asking that IRA be transferred back to employer's plan and to be made whole on any losses. Without consenting to the allegations, the Firm, as an act of good faith, has complied with the customer's request."",
