  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS CLIENT AND HER HUSBAND MET WITH ME DURING THEIR LUNCH AT CHEDDARS RESTAURANT IN BOLINGBROOK, ILLINOIS. I THOROUGHLY EXPLAINED GUIDED PORTFOLIO SERVICE AS A WAY FOR THE CLIENT TO REMAIN IN THE MARKET WHILE RECIEVING EXPERT MANAGEMENT OF HER FUNDS. I EXPLAINED THAT THE SERVICE WOULD SELECT, REBALANCE AND MANAGER HER PORTFOLIO ACCORDING TO HER NEEDS TO USE THE MONEY AS AN INCOME IN RETIREMENT. HER HUSBAND WANTED HER TO REMAIN IN THE MARKET BECAUSE THEY DID NOT NEED TO USE THESE FUNDS UNTIL SHE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE OUT HER RMD AT 70 1/2 YRS OF AGE. SHE AGREED. I EXCUSED MYSELF TO GO OUT TO MY CAR TO GET ADDITIONAL PAPERWORK.  WHEN I RETURNED WE COMPLETED THE PAPERWORK AND ENDED THE APPOINTMENT. I BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE CLIENT RECEIVED HER ANNUAL INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT AND SAW THAT SHE EXPERIENCED MORE LOSS THAN SHE WAS COMFORTABLE WITH SHE BEGAN SEEKING A WAY TO RECOVER HER LOSS.  SHE HAD A WHOLE YEAR THAT SHE RECEIVED STATEMENTS AND NEVER ONCE TRIED TO CONTACT ME OR THE SERVICE CENTER TO SAY THAT SHE HAD NOT ENROLLED IN THIS PROGRAM.  I HAD OVER A THOUSAND CLIENTS THAT I SERVICED FOR AIG AND HAD NEVER RECIEVED ONE COMPLAINT IN MY 4 YEARS AS AN ADVISOR NOR BEFORE THAT OR TO THIS DATE.  I HAD NO REASON TO PUT A CLIENT INTO A PROGRAM THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO BE IN. PLUS, I ALWAYS TELL EACH CLIENT THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT AT ANY TIME WITHOUT SUFFERING A PENALTY OF ANY SORT BUT THAT THEY WILL PAY THE ANNUAL FEE PRORATED AND CHARGED UP TO THE END OF THAT QUARTER. I ALWAYS COMPLETE MY BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS WITH THE UTMOST INTEGRITY AND HONESTY.  I AM BOTHERED AND INSULTED BY THIS COMPLAINT BUT I ALSO KNOW THE TRUTH.  I AM CONFIDENT IN MY BUSINESS PRACTICES AND KNOW THAT I WORK ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT IS EXPECTED AND DEMANDED ACCORDING TO THE NASD, SEC AND FINRA GUIDELINES.""
