  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS WAS AN EMBARRASMENT AND BIG MISUNDERSTANDING-I WAS ACCUSED OF TAKING BATTERIES FILM WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN PAID FOR AND WERE IN MY POSSESSION. I WAS PRICE COMPARING THE SAME ITEMS AT A DIFFERENT STORE-UPON LEAVING THE STORE I WAS DETAINED AND ASKED TO PRODUCE PROFF-RECEIPT. I DIDN'T HAVE RECEIPT ON MY PERSON AT THE TIME I WAS CITED. I REFAINED LEGAL COUNSEL INTO ADVISED IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE ECONOMICAL TO PLEAD NOLO THAN TO FIGHT THE CHARGE. I TOOK COUNSELS ADVICE PLEAD NOLO JUST TO SAVE MONEY. IN HANDSIGTH I MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF TO FIGHT I HOPE THIS IS HELPFUL IN PUTTING THIS TO REST.""
