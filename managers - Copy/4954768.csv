  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Mallory consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he failed to reasonably supervise a former registered representative, who, while registered through their member firm, recommended unsuitable trades in multiple customer accounts. The findings stated that Mallory did not take any steps to investigate red flags that the recommended purchases may not be suitable for the customers. Had he done so, Mallory would have learned that none of the customers were accredited and that the recommended purchases were inconsistent with the customers' express investment objectives and risk tolerance, as well as with their financial situation and needs, and, moreover, that none of the customers had authorized the transactions. The findings also stated that Mallory approved recommended securities transactions when he knew or should have known that the applications for such transactions contained false information. Mallory was aware of red flags that the representative submitted applications to purchase securities that incorrectly identified the associated person responsible for the account, but he did not investigate those red flags. On several occasions, Mallory initially rejected applications for securities transactions because the customers lived in states where the representative was not registered to conduct securities business, but then subsequently approved them when they were refiled under the representative's wife's name, who was also a registered representative of the firm at the time."",
