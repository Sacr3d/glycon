  ""Allegations"" : ""Henderson was named a respondent in a FINRA complaint alleging that he engaged in outside business activities without providing prior written notice to his member firm. The complaint alleges that one of Henderson's outside business activities sold its last condominium unit and he received approximately 10 percent of the proceeds from that sale. Henderson failed to provide written notice to his firm when he received the proceeds from the sale of the condominium unit. Henderson amended his Form U4 to disclose his involvement with these business activities after his firm had learned of his involvement with one of them when FINRA notified it, and after FINRA questioned Henderson concerning his involvement with the other. The complaint also alleges that Henderson willfully failed to timely amend his Form U4 to disclose federal tax liens, totaling more than $368,000."",
