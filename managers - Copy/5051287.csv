  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Recommended client to invest into a Wells Fargo Diversified Asset Allocation Wrap Program with a long time horizon (5+ Years). We ran a Financial Plan Envision \\u00ae to help support income needs well into retirement and till death. Client agreed and understood that portfolio's do go up and down & may lose value. Markets fluctuated and I informed client that given their time horizon and risk tolerance we should hold. Client acted against my recommendation and wished to sell. Thereafter, the markets fully recovered and continued to gain till now.""
