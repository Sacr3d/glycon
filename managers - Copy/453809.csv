  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN 1988, I TOOK OVER AS ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE ON THE INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS OF THE THREE ADULT CHILDREN OF MRS. VAN EVERY-RISHER, HEIRESS OF LANCE, INC. SUBSEQUENTLY, I ALSO BECAME THE ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE ON THREE TRUST ACCOUNTS ESTABLISHED BY MRS. VAN EVERY-RISHER, ONE FOR EACH OF HER CHILDREN. TOGETHER, THE ACCOUNTS WERE VALUED AT SEVERAL MILLION DOLARS. JAMES WHITNER, THE OLDEST OF THE THREE CHILDREN, WAS GIVEN POWER OF ATTORNEY OVER HIS SISTERS' ACCOUNTS, AND WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMUNICATING TO ME ALL DECISIONS REGARDING INVESTMENTS IN THE ACCOUNTS. IN EARLY 1989, THE THREE CHILDREN RECEIVED 300 SHARES OF LANCE STOCK AS A GIFT. THE SHARE CERTIFICATES WERE SENT DIRECTLY TO ME. AT MR. WHITNER'S DIRECTION AND WITH HIS EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION, I SIGNED THE CERTIFICATES ON BEHALF OF THE THREE CHILDREN SO THE CERTIFICATES COULD BE DEPOSITED INTO THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTS. IN FACT, ALL THE CERTIFICATES WERE DEPOSITED AS DIRECTED BY MR. WHITNER. ""
