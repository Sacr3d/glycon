  ""Allegations"" : ""WHILE REGISTERED WITH SGC, RESPONDENT REPRESENTED TO CO-WORKERS, SGC CLIENTS, SGC PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS, AND SGC FINANCIAL ADVISORS THAT HE WAS A CHARTERED FINANCIAL ANALYST (CFA).  RESPONDENT WAS NOT, AND HAS NEVER BEEN, A CFA CHARTERHOLDER.  HOWEVER, RESPONDENT USED THE CFA DESIGNATION ON THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS AND ON HIS BUSINESS CARDS.  RESPONDENT ALSO FABRICATED AN E-MAIL TO SGC TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE CFA INSTITUTE HAD SENT THE MESSAGE TO CONGRATULATE RESPONDENT ON PASSING THE LEVEL III CFA EXAM.  IN REALITY, RESPONDENT FAILED THE LEVEL I CFA EXAM THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME HE TOOK IT.  RESPONDENT'S ACTIONS CONSTITUTE FRAUDULENT BUSINESS PRACTICES.  FURTHERMORE, RESPONDENT CONDUCTED MISLEADING PERFORMANCE REPORTING FOR SGC VIA PERSONALIZED PROPOSALS (PITCHBOOKS) FOR SGC FINANCIAL ADVISORS TO USE IN PRESENTATIONS WITH PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS.  ORIGINALLY, THE PERFORMANCE CHARTS IN THE PITCHBOOKS WERE LABELED AS HYPOTHETICAL OR MODEL PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THE CHARTS WERE NOT BASED ON ACTUAL RETURNS OF THE PROGRAM.  RATHER, THE RETURNS WERE CALCULATED BY BACKTESTING EXISTING ALLOCATIONS AGAINST HISTORICAL DATA.  IN OR ABOUT OCTOBER 2006, CONCERNS WERE RAISED BECAUSE THE HYPOTHETICAL RETURNS CONTAINED IN THE PITCHBOOKS DID NOT MATCH THE ACTUAL RETURNS IN CLIENT PORTFOLIOS.  AUDITING COMMENCED AND PERFORMANCE CHARTS BEGAN CALCULATING RETURNS BASED ON A COMPOSITE OF ACTUAL CLIENT RETURNS.  THE PITCHBOOKS THEN BEGAN TO CONTAIN AUIDITED, COMPOSITE RETURNS FOR YEARS STARTING IN 2005 BUT CONTINUED TO INCLUDE THE UNAUDITED PERFORMANCE DATA FOR 2000 THROUGH 2004.  THIS SET OF DATA WAS LABELED \""HISTORICAL\"" EVEN THOUGH THE 2000 THROUGH 2004 FIGURES WERE NOT ACTUAL RETURNS.  RESPONDENT KNEW OF THE MISLEADING LABELING."",

  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC ADMIN RELEASE 34-67773, IA RELEASE 3455, INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 RELEASE 30192, AUGUST 31, 2012:  THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\""COMMISSION\"") DEEMED IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 15(B) AND 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (\""EXCHANGE ACT\""), SECTIONS 203(F) AND 203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 (\""ADVISERS ACT\""), AND SECTION 9(B) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 (\""INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT\"") AGAINST JASON A. D'AMATO (\""D'AMATO\"").  FROM MAY 2003 THROUGH FEBRUARY 2009, D'AMATO SERVED IN  VARIOUS ROLES FOR A DUALLY-REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISER (\""FIRM\"") AND AN INVESTMENT ADVISER FIRM (\""ADVISER\""). FROM NOVEMBER 2005 THROUGH AT LEAST SEPTEMBER 2008, D'AMATO MANAGED A PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUND WRAP PROGRAM FOR THE ADVISER AND THE FIRM. DURING THIS TIME, D'AMATO MADE ALL INVESTMENT DECISIONS FOR EACH OF THE PROGRAM'S STRATEGIES (INCOME, BALANCED INCOME, BALANCED, BALANCED GROWTH, AND GROWTH).  IN 2000, THE FIRM BEGAN OFFERING A MUTUAL FUND ALLOCATION PROGRAM THROUGH ITS INVESTMENT ADVISORY GROUP (\""IAG\""). THE PROGRAM OFFERED SEVERAL DIFFERENT STRATEGIES DEPENDING ON AN INVESTOR'S RISK THRESHOLD AND INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, WHICH WERE DETERMINED BASED ON AN INVESTOR'S RESPONSES TO A QUESTIONNAIRE. THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF THE PROGRAM, THERE WERE AS MANY AS 10 AND AS FEW AS FIVE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES/ALLOCATIONS, INCLUDING INCOME, BALANCED INCOME, BALANCED, BALANCED GROWTH, AND GROWTH.  IN MAY 2003, THE FIRM HIRED D'AMATO AS AN ASSISTANT ANALYST IN THE IAG TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TRACK AND CALCULATE THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH PROGRAM STRATEGY AND CREATE PERSONALIZED PROPOSALS (\""PITCHBOOKS\"") FOR FIRM FINANCIAL ADVISERS (\""FAS\"") TO USE IN ONE-ON-ONE PRESENTATIONS TO PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS. THE SUBSTANCE AND LENGTH OF THE PITCHBOOKS EVOLVED OVER TIME, BUT NEARLY EVERY VERSION CONTAINED SEVERAL CHARTS SHOWING THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH STRATEGY DATING BACK TO 2000. THE CHARTS WERE VARIOUSLY LABELED \""HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE,\"" \""HYPOTHETICAL HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE,\"" OR \""MODEL PERFORMANCE.\"" REGARDLESS OF THE LABEL, THE ACTUAL DATA IN THE PITCHBOOKS REMAINED CONSISTENT.  IN OR AROUND SEPTEMBER 2004, D'AMATO CALCULATED THE PERFORMANCE RETURNS FOR EACH PROGRAM STRATEGY BY BACKTESTING EXISTING ALLOCATIONS AGAINST HISTORICAL DATA FOR THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS (I.E., IF A CLIENT HELD THE SEPTEMBER 2004 ALLOCATION BACK IN 2000, THIS IS HOW IT WOULD HAVE PERFORMED). IAG PRESENTED THESE MODEL RETURNS IN PITCHBOOK CHARTS AND COMPARED THEM TO THE S&P 500 RETURNS FOR THE SAME TIME PERIOD. FOR THE PERIOD OF 2000 TO 2005, THE BACKTESTED MODELS CONSISTENTLY OUTPERFORMED THE S&P 500 BY AN OVERWHELMING PERCENTAGE.  IN NOVEMBER 2005, D'AMATO BECAME THE DIRECTOR OF IAG AND THE PROGRAM'S PORTFOLIO MANAGER. IN SEPTEMBER 2006, IAG CHANGED THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM, SEPARATED FROM THE FIRM AND FORMED A NEW COMPANY. D'AMATO CONTINUED TO MANAGE THE PROGRAM AND MAKE INVESTMENT DECISIONS FOR EACH OF THE PROGRAM'S PORTFOLIOS.  IN OR AROUND OCTOBER 2006, SEVERAL FIRM FAS EXPRESSED \""SERIOUS CONCERNS\"" TO THE FIRM'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE RETURNS PRESENTED IN PROGRAM PITCHBOOKS. THE FAS COMPLAINED THAT NONE OF THEIR CLIENTS HAD ACHIEVED THE RETURNS THAT THE COMPANY TOUTED. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM HIRED A PERFORMANCE REPORTING CONSULTANT TO IDENTIFY THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE RETURNS PRESENTED IN THE PITCHBOOKS AND THE RETURNS ACHIEVED IN ACTUAL PROGRAM ACCOUNTS. FOR AT LEAST 2005 AND 2006, THE CONSULTANT CONCLUDED THAT: (I) ACTUAL RETURNS EARNED BY PROGRAM CLIENTS WERE, IN MOST CASES, HUNDREDS OF BASIS POINTS LOWER THAN THE RETURNS ADVERTISED IN THE PITCHBOOKS, AND (II) D'AMATO AND HIS TEAM OF ANALYSTS DID NOT KEEP RECORDS TO SHOW CONTEMPORANEOUS CHANGES IN EACH OF THE PROGRAM'S STRATEGIES PRIOR TO 2005, SO THE CONSULTANT COULD NOT VERIFY THE PRE-2005 NUMBERS.
