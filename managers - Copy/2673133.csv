  ""Allegations"" : ""CLAIMAINTS ALLEGE THAT THEY INVESTED IN FRANKLIN SQUARE BDCs, HINES GLOBAL REIT, HMS INCOME FUND, WP CAREY, CIM REAL ESTATE FINANCIAL TRUST, KBS REAL ESTATE TRUST AND CION INVESTMENT CORP UPON THEIR BROKER'S MISLEADING RECOMMENDATION, WHICH DID NOT SUIT THEIR ALLEGEDLY CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENT PROFILE.  ACTIVITY PERIOD:  6/2010 TO 9/2019.  ALTHOUGH I AM NOT A NAMED PARTY IN THIS ARBITRATION, I INTEND TO WORK WITH LPL TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE STATEMENT OF CLAIM ARE FALSE.  THE ARBITRATION ALLEGATIONS DO NOT MENTION THAT THE CLIENT MADE SIGNIFICAT REURNS OVERALL AND ON ALL BUT ONE OF THE INVESTMENTS AT ISSUE.  THE ALLEGATIONS DO NOT MENTION THE DISTRIBUTIONS THE CLIENT RECEIVED OVER THE MANY YEARS, OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE CLIENT'S DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO.  THE INVESTMENTS AT ISSUE COLLECTIVITY COMPRISED WELL UNDER 15% OF THE CLIENT'S REPORTED LIQUID NET WORTH, AND THE CLIENT WAS NOT OVER-CONCENTRATED.  THE CLIENT TOOK THE TIME TO REVIEW ALL THE OFFERING MATERIALS, INCLUDING EACH PROSPECTUS AS WELL AS OTHER MATERIAL BEFORE THE CLIENT ELECTED TO PROCEED WITH EACH INVESTMENT.  IN CONNETION WITH LAST PURCHASE MANY YEARS AGO, THE CLIENT HANDWROTE \""I WANT TO RECEIVE MORE INCOME THAT I AM CURRENTLY RECEIVING IN THE MONEY MARKET.\""  HE ALSO AFFIRMED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT: \""THE CLIENT WANTS TO HAVE A MORE DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO INCLUDING FIXED INCOME, ALTERNATIVES, AND EQUITIES.  HE IS WILLING TO TAKE MORE RISK IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE HIS DIVERSIFICATION.\""  ULTIMATELY, THE INVESTMENTS COMPLAINED OF BY THE CLIENT WERE SUITABLE FOR HIS NEEDS AT THE TIME THEY WERE MADE, AND HE UNDERSTOOD THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THEM.  THE CLIENT NEVER COMPLAINED ABOUT THESE INVESTMENTS FOR MANY YEARS WHILE HE COLLECTED DISTRIBUTIONS, AND HE REINVESTED THE DIVIDENDS TO CONTINUE TO PURCHASE MORE SHARES.  FOR THESE REASONS AND MORE, I ASSERT THAT THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE ARBITRATION HAVE NOT MERIT."",

THE CLIENT WAS NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE PURCHASE OF THE SECURITY BUT RATHER THAT I HAD ADVISED HIM NOT TO SELL THE SECURITY AFTER IT HAD LOST SOME OF ITS VALUE.  WE HAD ACTUALLY PLACED A LIMIT ORDER TO SELL THIS SECURITY AFTER WE TALKED, INSTEAD OF PLACING THE STOP-LOSS ORDER.  NOWHERE IN THE EMAIL DOES HE MAKE MENTION THAT HE IS UPSET ABOUT THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE, ONLY THE LACK OF A STOP-LOSS ORDER TO LIMIT HIS DOWNSIDE AND THAT I HAD ADVISED AGAINST PLACING THIS STOP LOSS ORDER.  IN FACT, AS NOTED IN TWO EMAILS FROM 7/3/07 THE CLIENT STATES THAT HE WAS HAPPY WITH ALL OF THE SECURITIES IN HIS ACCOUNT.  HE DID NOT ALLEGE SPECIFIC DAMAGES.  THE CLIENT'S CLAIMS WERE DENIED AS HAVING NO MERIT.""
