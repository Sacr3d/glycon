  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Moved from KS to MD in 2009. Tried to sell our house in 2009 and couldn't. Rented it for less than our mortgage for 2 years and then tried to sell it again in 2011. Sold it for less than the loan amounts and couldn't make up the difference. James B. Nutter and CitiMortgage agreed to a short-sale and the deal was final in September of 2011.""
