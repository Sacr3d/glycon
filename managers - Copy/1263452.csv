EACH ACCOUNT AND INVESTMENT PRODUCT CONSIDERED AND/OR OPENED FOR [CUSTOMER] WAS FULLY AND THOROUGHLY EXPLAINED IN DETAIL IN ORDER TO INSURE [CUSTOMER'S] COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING AND COMFORT.  THE INVESTMENT CHOICES CONSIDERED WERE CAREFULLY PLANNED OUT AND DISCUSSED WITH THIS CLIENT.  ONLY AFTER A LENGTHY ON-GOING DIALOGUE, HAVING BEEN ASSURED THE CLIENT UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED WITH THE PLAN, WERE INVESTMENTS TRANSACTED.  IN ADDITION, THE \""MANAGED ACCOUNT\"" EVENTUALLY OPENED FOR [CUSTOMER] WAS A MANAGED MUTUAL FUND ACCOUNT COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A \""WRAP\"" ACCOUNT.
