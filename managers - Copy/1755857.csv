  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This lien was placed on Mitch Mellen prior to his employment at Brinker Capital. Port-A-Pier was contracted to install a deck at Mitch's property and there was a dispute of the cost. Mitch moved to Michigan and was unaware there was a court date scheduled so he did not attend the hearing.  Port-A-Pier has not pursued payment for the dock that was built on the property and Mitch feels he was overcharged for the work and it couldn't be settled.  The Compliance Department was made aware of this after running an annual background check on our employees.""
