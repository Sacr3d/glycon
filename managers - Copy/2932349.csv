AFTER AN INVESTIGATION, THE DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT ALLEGES THAT: BETWEEN 2006 AND 2012, A CORPORATION AND ITS PRINCIPAL OFFICERS RAISED AT LEAST $17.4 MILLION FROM APPROXIMATELY 440 INVESTORS NATIONWIDE THROUGH A SERIES OF FRAUDULENT, UNREGISTERED OFFERINGS OF STOCK AND BONDS. THE CORPORATION REPRESENTED THAT IT WAS PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF BUYING AND SELLING FRACTIONAL INTERESTS IN OIL AND GAS PRODUCING PROPERTIES AND ALSO ENGAGED IN COMMODITIES TRADING IN THE FUTURES MARKET. THE CORPORATION USED A PORTION OF THE INVESTOR FUNDS TO BUY FRACTIONAL INTERESTS IN OIL AND GAS WELLS, CATTLE, AND A HYDROGEN DEVICE THAT PURPORTED TO INCREASE GAS MILEAGE ON VEHICLES, TRADE COMMODITIES CONTRACTS, AND INVEST IN REAL ESTATE. THE CORPORATION AND ITS PRINCIPAL OFFICERS MADE MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS ABOUT THE CORPORATION'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND USE OF INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND TECHNOLOGIES IN THE CORPORATION'S OFFERING MATERIAL AND CORRESPONDENCE TO INVESTORS. ITS PRINCIPAL OFFICERS ALSO TOUTED THEIR AFFILIATION WITH A CHARITY ORGANIZATION IN THE CORPORATION'S OFFERING MATERIALS BUT THAT CHARITY NEVER HAD ANY SUBSTANTIVE CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES. STARTING IN 2009, THE CORPORATION ALSO HIRED UNREGISTERED SALES AGENTS TO SELL ITS BONDS PAYING THEM COMMISSIONS OF 5 PERCENT OR 10 PERCENT OF THE INVESTOR PROCEEDS. THE CORPORATION AND A PRINCIPAL EMPLOYED THE UNREGISTERED SALES AGENTS TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE CORPORATION EVEN AFTER RECEIVING AN EMAIL AND OTHER CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE CORPORATION'S OUTSIDE COUNSEL DETAILING THE LIMITS ON THE CORPORATION'S USE OF UNREGISTERED SALES AGENTS. THE CORPORATION'S TOP GROSSING INDEPENDENT SALES AGENTS INCLUDED SALOVAY. COLLECTIVELY, THEY EARNED APPROXIMATELY $985,000 IN TRANSACTION-BASED COMPENSATION IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR SALES ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT OF THE CONDUCT, SALOVAY WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 15(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934."",
