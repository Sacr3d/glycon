I AGREED TO REIMBURSE TO THE CONTRACTS (CLIENTS) THE DIFFERENCE IN MORTALITY COSTS (EXCESS DEATH BENEFITS) AS REQUESTED BY THE CLIENT FOR YEAR ONE AND SECURITY LIFE OF DENVER AGREED TO CREDIT DIFFERENCE FOR YEAR TWO.  THE POLICIES HAVE BEEN REISSURED TO THE CLIENTS.

THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE SETTLEMENT WAS $9,841.15. AFTER THE INITIAL DESIGN, THE CLIENT DETERMINED THAT FUNDING WOULD NOT GROW BEYOND THE INITIAL $20,000 PER YEAR DEPOSITED THE FIRST YEAR.  MY DESIGN WAS BASED ON THEM INCREASING ABOVE THE $20,000 PER YEAR.  SO, BASED ON THIS WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A LOWER DEATH BENEFIT WHICH IS WHAT WAS COMPLETED LAST MONTH AS REQUESTED BY THE CLIENT.""
