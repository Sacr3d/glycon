  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Stopkey consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he effected approximately 300 trades in seven accounts owned by four senior customers without first speaking with the customers on the days he effected the trade orders. The findings stated that although the customers orally authorized Stopkey to exercise discretion in their accounts, they had not given written authorization for the accounts to be discretionary. Nor did the member firm approve the customer accounts as discretionary. Additionally, on three firm compliance questionnaires, Stopkey inaccurately stated that he had not utilized time or price discretion, or entered trade orders prior to speaking with a client, in a client account. Further, in response to compliance staff's inquiry into one of the subject trades, Stopkey inaccurately suggested that the trade was the customer's idea. The findings also stated that Stopkey caused the firm to maintain inaccurate books and records. Stopkey marked order tickets for trades in the customer accounts referenced above as unsolicited although he did not discuss the trades with the customers."",
