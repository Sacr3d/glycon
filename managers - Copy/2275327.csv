  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I LEARNED OF THIS MATTER WHEN THE ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE DECLINED MY APPLICATION FOR NON-RESIDENT LICENSE DUE TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION BY THE OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE STATE OF GEORGIA.  THE STATE OF GEORGIA HAS SINCE REINSTATED MY LICENSE BY CONSENT ORDER, DATED 6/24/99.  THE OVERSIGHT ON THE RENEWAL OF MY LICENSE OCCURRED BECAUSE THE FIRM, INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT GROUP (IFMG), WHICH CLEARED AND PROCESSED OUR ANNUITY BUSINESS LICENSES NEVER PROCESSED MY RENEWAL APPLICATION IN 1998. AS A RESULT, IT WAS NOT UNTIL JUNE OF 1999 THAT I DISCOVERED MY LICENSES HAD NEVER BEEN RENEWED.  THE FACT IS I DID COMPLY WITH THE STATE OF GEORGIA'S REQUIREMENTS BY FULFILLING THE CE REQUIREMENTS, COMPLETING THE RENEWAL APPLICATION AND FORWARDING THESE ITEMS TO IFMG BECAUSE THEY TRACKED THE CE'S FOR SOUTHTRUST SECURITIES, INC. AND THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE RENEWAL FEES.  IFMG ADMITTED TO RECEIVING MY DOCUMENTS AND FAILING TO FORWARD THEM TO THE STATE.  AS SOON AS I DISCOVERED THE OVERSIGHT I COMPLIED WITH THEIR PROCEDURES FOR REINSTATEMENT AND WAS INFORMED ON 7/19/99 THAT I WAS BACK IN GOOD STANDING. THIS ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY SALES PRACTICES  NOR ANY FINANCIALLY-RELATED MATTER.""
