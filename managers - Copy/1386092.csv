ALTHOUGH THE CLIENT DID ASK ME NOT TO FORWARD LIQUIDATION PAPERWORK TO THEIR (PRIOR) BROKER UNTIL THEY GAVE ME PERMISSION, I DID IN FACT WAIT AND THEY GAVE ME SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO LIQUIDATE.  IN FACT THEY MADE AN EXTRA TRIP TO MY OFFICE BEFORE GOING ON VACATION TO SIGN ADDITIONAL PAPERWORK (THEY ALSO GAVE ME A PHONE # WHERE THEY COULD BE REACHED WHILE THEY WERE AWAY SO THAT I COULD KEEP THEM INFORMED ABOUT THE TRANSFER.  THEY SUBSEQUENTLY CALLED THEIR PRIOR AND RESCINDED THE TRANSFER WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE. THE PRIOR BROKER SHOULD HAVE CANCELLED THE LIQUIDATION BUT DID NOT.  SINCE I NEVER HAD CONTROL OF THE ASSETS, I WAS NOT AT FAULT.""
