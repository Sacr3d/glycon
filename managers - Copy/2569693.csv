  ""Allegations"" : ""THE SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 23134 / NOVEMBER 17, 2014: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION CHARGED JOSEPH A. NOEL, THE CEO OF A SAN FRANCISCO-BASED PENNY STOCK COMPANY, WITH DEFRAUDING INVESTORS BY ISSUING FALSE AND MISLEADING PRESS RELEASES PORTRAYING HIS PURPORTED MARKETING AND INFOMERCIAL COMPANY AS A SUCCESSFUL VENTURE IN ORDER TO DRIVE THE STOCK PRICE UP WHILE HE COVERTLY SOLD MILLIONS OF SHARES INTO THE PUBLIC MARKET FOR MORE THAN $300,000 IN ILLICIT PROFITS. THE SEC'S COMPLAINT CHARGES NOEL WITH VIOLATING ANTIFRAUD AND REGISTRATION PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S COMPLAINT FILED AGAINST NOEL IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN SAN FRANCISCO, THE DECEPTIVE PRESS RELEASES ABOUT HIS COMPANY YESDTC HOLDINGS TOUTED EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS, LICENSING AGREEMENTS, AND CERTAIN PRODUCTS PURPORTEDLY CERTIFIED BY THE GOVERNMENT. NOEL'S PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS BASED ON SUCH FALSE INFORMATION CAUSED A SPIKE IN YESDTC'S THINLY-TRADED STOCK AND ENABLED HIM TO DUMP MILLIONS OF HIS OWN SHARES FOR A PROFIT. TO CONCEAL HIS SALES, NOEL SOLD THE SHARES THROUGH A COMPANY HE CREATED IN HIS TEENAGE DAUGHTER'S NAME WITHOUT DISCLOSING AS REQUIRED THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY SELLING THE SHARES. THE SEC ALSO SUSPENDED TRADING IN YESDTC STOCK, AND INSTITUTED AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING TO REVOKE ITS REGISTRATION."",
