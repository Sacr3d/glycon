  ""Broker Comment"" : ""AT THE AGE OF 19, TOWARDS THE END OF 2002 I PRINTED OUT A COUPLE OF FAKE ID'S FOR MYSELF AND A FRIEND TO GAIN ENTRY INTO LOCAL TAVERNS.  A CASE WAS BROUGHT AGAINST ME IN 2004 BY THE MUNICIPALITY OF HAMILTON TOWNSHIP (NJ) AND LATER TRANSFERED TO THE STATE OF NJ. THE INCIDENT REMAINED UNINDICTED FOR NEARLY FOUR YEARS. FINALLY, IN OR ABOUT SEPTEMBER 8, 2006 I WAS ENTERED INTO A DIVERSIONARY PROGRAM CALLED PRETRIAL INTERVENTION (PTI). CONSIDERING I WAS ENTERED INTO PTI, I DID NOT PLEAD GUILTY, HOWEVER I HAVE ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS. I HAVE SINCE COMPLETED THE DIVERSIONARY PROGRAM WHICH CONSISTED OF A FINE AND COMMUNITY SERVICE. THE CHARGE WAS DISMISSED FROM MY RECORD ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2008.  THE \""ORDER OF DISMISSAL\"" HAS BEEN PROVIDED. I REALIZE THAT I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE THAT I CERTAINLY REGRET.  I HAVE MADE MANY MISTAKES IN MY LIFE, BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN, I HAVE LEARNED FROM ALL OF THEM.  ULTIMATELY, THIS INCIDENT CHANGED MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER. IN THE PAST 7 YEARS AFTER THIS INCIDENT, I HAVE LIVED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IF I DO THE NEXT RIGHT THING, GOOD THINGS WILL CONTINUE HAPPEN IN MY LIFE. THAT ADVICE IS FROM MY FATHER AND IT IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY.  I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT MY STRONG TRACK RECORD OF HONESTY AND INTEGRITY OVER THE PAST 7 YEARS WILL OUTWEIGH THIS MISTAKE I MADE WHEN I WAS 19 YEARS OF AGE.""
