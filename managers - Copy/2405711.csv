  ""Broker Comment"" : ""WHEN I BECAME A FULL TIME FA, MY INCOME INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, SO I HIRED A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED CPA TO HANDLE MY FILING AND GAVE HER POWER OF ATTORNEY.  SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH [REDACTED] AND DUE TO HER EFFORTS IN SEEKING CURE (SHE IS A [REDACTED] SURVIVOR) MY FILING WAS PUT ON HOLD...BEFORE LEAVING HAWAII, SHE FINALLY RETURNED EVERYTHING TO ME.   I FOUND A CPA HERE IN UTAH AND HE SUBMITTED A COUPLE OF THE RETURNS SHE COMPLETED AND FINISHED THE REMAINING YEARS.  WE SENT A LETTER TO THE IRS EXPLAINING ALL AND REQUESTED THEY APPLY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN REFUNDS TO THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS DUE.  LONG STORY SHORT, I AM DISPUTING THE AMOUNTS DUE AND HAVE BEEN PLACED ON A 2 YEAR UNCOLLECTIBLE STATUS WHICH STARTED MID LAST YEAR.  I NOW HAVE A NEW CPA WHO BELIEVES IT CAN ALL BE CLEARED.""
