  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CUSTOMER WAS AWARDED ACTUAL/COMPENSATORY DAMAGES OF $2,561.11 JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY.  ALL OTHER RELIEF WAS DENIED.  I DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT AMOUNT. CUSTOMER RECEIVED INACCURATE ADVICE FROM HER TAX ADVISOR, MADE SOME TRADES, AND TRIED TO BLAME US.  THE ONLY RECOMPENSE WAS THE COMMISSION, NO DAMAGES FOR ANY OTHER REASON.  ACCORDING TO MY ATTORNEY, IT WASN'T NECESSARY TO AMMEND THE U-4 AS THE REQUESTED DAMAGES WERE BELOW $10,000 AND THE SETTLEMENT WAS UNDER $5,000.  THERE WAS NO FINING OF FRAUD, WRONGFUL TAKING OF PROPERTY ETC.  I AM ANGRY THAT MY U-4 SHOULD BE TARNISHED OVER THIS WHEN THERE WAS NO FINDING OF GUILT, AND ONLY A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF DAMAGES.""
