  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The Advisor is not in agreement with the Internal Revenue Service as it relates to the amount due nor to the lien filing. The Advisor was told by the IRS that the lien would not be filed pending the resolution of the actual liability in question. An appeal hearing request has been filed by the Advisor. This request was submitted in a timely fashion and in good order. The appeal request was granted and will take place in October 2018. This will be updated following the findings of that ruling""
