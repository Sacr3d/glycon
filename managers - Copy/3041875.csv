  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I had a drastic drop in income that I did not have time to plan for. I added debt and then got behind on debts when my income did not increase. After 4 years, when my income got back to a level that could support us, I reached out to creditors and negotiated settlements. I forgot that compromise with creditors is a question on the U4 until I heard it mentioned in a meeting last week.  I reached out to Compliance as soon as I realized it was reportable.""
