  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN A 2008 NON-RESIDENT INSURANCE LICENSE APPLICATION TO THE GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE (GADOI), I MISREAD THE APPLICATION TO ASK WHETHER I HAD EVER BEEN FINED OR FOUND GUILTY IN ANY REGULATORY ACTION. I ANSWERED \""NO\"" BECAUSE I SETTLED A 1994 VIRGINIA ALLEGATION THAT I REBATED AND ACTED AS AN UNLICENSED \""INSURANCE CONSULTANT\"". A SETTLEMENT IS NOT A FINE; NOT A \""FINDING\"". I TECHNICALLY - BUT NOT MENDACIOUSLY - MISINTERPRETED THE 2008 APPLICATION WORDING. IT ASKED WHETHER I HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN A REGULATORY ACTION. I REVISED MY APPLICATION. BUT REGULATOR SHARON BAILEY STATED THAT GADOI HAS A NEW RULE REQUIRING A FINE FOR ANY INCORRECT ANSWER; WITHOUT REGARD TO INNOCENT ERROR VS MENDACITY. SHE POSSESSED NO EVIDENCE OF INTENT TO MISREPRESENT, AND DID POSSESS EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE. SHE DISMISSED THE CORRECTED APPLICATION AND IMPOSED A FINE FOR \""MISREPRESENTATION\"", ASSERTING THAT 1.SHE HAD NO OBLIGATION TO DISTINGUISH DECEPTION FROM MISTAKE AND 2.THE WORD \""MISREPRESENTATION\"" DOES NOT MEAN \""A LIE\""; IT MEANS ANY INCORRECT STATEMENT. SHE DECLINED TO COMMENT ON HOW THE PUBLIC MIGHT INTERPRET THE WORD. EVIDENCE THAT I DID NOT CONCEAL IS IN THE FACT THAT IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT ALL INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS ACCESS THE NAIC SYSTEM FOR ALL APPLICANTS, AND THAT THE VADOI SETTLEMENT APPEARED ON THAT SYSTEM. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THERE WAS NO INCENTIVE TO CONCEAL. IN FEBRUARY 2009 I HAD TO ACCEPT GADOI'S $300 FINE. THE READER SHOULD PONDER THE FACT THAT THE GADOI REGULATOR MADE A CHOICE TO EXCLUDE EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE NOTED ABOVE FROM ITS CONSENT ORDER. ALSO IMPORTANT IS THE FACT THAT THE REGULATOR MADE A CHOICE TO CREATE A MISLEADING ENTRY IN THE RECORD, GIVEN THE CONNOTATION OF \""MISREPRESENTATION\"" WHEN THE LICENSE APPLICATION CONTAINED AN ERROR RATHER THAN A LIE. FINALLY, THE CONSENT ORDER STATES THAT THE LICENSE WOULD BE ISSUED WITHOUT RESTRICTION - UPON GADOI RECEIPT OF THE SIGNED ORDER AND $300. THE GADOI ACTION STEMMED FROM INTERACTION WITH THE REGULATOR, WHICH HAS THE HONORABLE & NECESSARY RESPONSIBILITY OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS; NOT FROM INTERACTION WITH CONSUMERS.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN 1992 I SUBMITTED MY INVESTMENT ADVISOR CONTRACT TO VIRGINIA'S INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT ADVISOR DEPARTMENTS FOR COMMENT PRIOR TO FINAL DRAFT. THAT CONTRACT LISTED ITEMIZED FOR-FEE FINANCIAL PLANNING PROVIDED, INCLUDING CALCULATING THE LIFE INSURANCE A FAMILY NEEDED. THE CONTRACT ALSO OFFERED FEE WAIVER TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY COMMISSION WAS EARNED. I SOON RECEIVED A CALL FROM A VA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE (VADOI) OFFICIAL WHO STATED THAT NO ADVICE COULD BE GIVEN ON CONTRACT DRAFTING, BUT THAT I WAS OBVIOUSLY CONSUMER-FRIENDLY. TWO YEARS LATER, THE VADOI ALLEGED THAT: 1.THE FEE WAIVER WAS \""REBATING\"" AND 2.CALCULATING FAMILIES' COVERAGE NEEDS FOR FEE WAS \""INSURANCE CONSULTING\"", A NEW LICENSURE FOR BENEFITS CONSULTANTS AND DISTINCT FROM INSURANCE SALES. IT REQUIRED EXTRA LICENSING FEES PAID TO THE VADOI. I WAS INTIMIDATED INTO SETTLING THE MATTER: THE VADOI STATED THAT, IF I FOUGHT THIS, IT WOULD SEEK FRIGHTENING PENALTIES, BUT THAT IT WOULD ACCEPT $500 TO SETTLE THE MATTER AND NOT CATEGORIZE IT AS A \""FINE\"" OR \""FINDING\"". EVENTUALLY, THE VADOI CLARIFIED THAT FAMILY INSURANCE NEEDS ANALYSIS WAS NOT \""INSURANCE CONSULTING\"", EVEN IF PART OF WORK FOR FEE. BUT THAT WAS TOO LATE. AS FOR THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE WAIVER CONSTITUTING REBATING, I WAS WRONG, BUT UNINTENTIONALLY SO BECAUSE THE REBATING DEFINITION WAS UNCLEAR. THE VADOI COMMISSIONER STATED IN WRITING THAT BOTH VIOLATIONS WERE BY MISTAKE, NOT INTENTIONAL. I LACKED COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT SUPPORT THEN FOR THE DESIGN OF THE ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND FOR CONTESTING THE VADOI ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION. BUT, IN OVER TWO DECADES OF LICENSURE, I HAVE NEVER FLOUTED ANY LAW OR RULE NOR HAD ANY CONSUMER COMPLAINT.""
