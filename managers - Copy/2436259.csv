  ""Broker Comment"" : ""[CUSTOMER] IS MISTAKEN AND UNWILLING TO LOOK AT THE FACTS OF THIS MATTER.  HE OPTED FOR AND AGREED TO A BUYOUT OFFER ON HIS AXA ANNUITY AND ROLLED THAT BALANCE ALONG WITH HIS BROKERAGE ACCOUNT BALANCE TOGETHER INTO A NEW NATIONWIDE ANNUITY.  WHEN HE LOGGED INTO OUR ACCOUNT AGGREGATION SOFTWARE SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, THE OLD AXA ANNUITY WAS STILL REFLECTED IN THE SOFTWARE WITH AN OLD DATE AND VALUE TO IT, ALONG WITH THE NEW VALUE FOR THE NATIONWIDE ANNUITY, EFFECTIVELY, DOUBLE COUNTING THE VALUE OF SOME OF HIS ASSETS.  WHILE WE HAVE THOROUGHLY SUPPLIED HIM WITH THE RESEARCH RELATED TO ALL OF HIS ACCOUNTS AND MONEY MOVEMENT, HE IS UNWILLING TO LISTEN TO THE TRUE FACTS AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER.  WE HAVE DENIED THE CLAIM BECAUSE THERE IS NO ACTUAL LOSS IN ASSETS TO HIM AND THERE IS NOTHING MISSING.   WHILE WE HAVE EXPLAINED AND APOLOGIZED FOR THE CONFUSION ON THE ACCOUNT AGGREGATION SOFTWARE, THE SOFTWARE DID PROPERLY REFLECT THE VALUE AT THE TIME THE TRANSFER WAS MADE OUT OF AXA AND INTO THE NATIONWIDE ANNUITY, WITH THE PROPER DATE, HE IS UNWILLING TO ACCEPT OUR PROPER ANSWER.  WE HAVE EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT HE ALSO RECEIVED INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT STATEMENTS FROM EACH OF HIS RESPECTIVE HOLDINGS TO HELP HIM VERIFY THIS MATTER, BUT HE IS UNWILLING TO PARTAKE IN THAT EXERCISE.  CLEARLY, IF HE WERE TO MATCH UP HIS FINAL AXA ANNUITY STATEMENT, HE WOULD SEE THE TRANSFER OF THE ENTIRE VALUE TO THE NATIONWIDE ANNUITY AND THAT THE AXA ANNUITY STATEMENT WOULD REFLECT A ZERO BALANCE.  OUR ACCOUNT AGGREGATION SOFTWARE IS AN ACCOMMODATION FOR OUR CLIENTS, BUT THE ACTUAL ACCOUNT STATEMENTS FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE BROKERAGE FIRMS ARE THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS TO RELY UPON, WHICH [CUSTOMER] IS UNWILLING TO DO TO SEEK THE TRUTH.""
