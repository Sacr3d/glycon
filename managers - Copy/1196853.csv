  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I DONT KNOW YET-I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FIRST-I RESIGNED FROM PRUDENTIAL-NO ONE ALLOWED ME TO RESIGN; SECOND-I TRIED TO REACH THE PERSON TO GET HER SIGNATURE ON THE AUTOMOBILE APPLICATION-BEING UNSUCCESSFUL I SIGNED HER NAME. I DID NOT INTENTIONALLY TRY TO HARM HER BY DOING THIS. I JUST WANTED TO GET HER COVERED. THIRD- THERE IS NO MONEY MISSING-IT WAS LATE IN BEING PAID. NO COVERAGE WAS CANCELLED OR LAPSED. I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL ABOVE ACTIONS. I MAY HAVE MADE A POOR CHOICE IN DOING SOMETHING-BUT I DID NOT TRY TO MISLEAD ANYONE.""
