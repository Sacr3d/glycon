  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""AN INTERNAL REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED AS A RESULT OF THE FIRM RECEIVING A CLIENT COMPLAINT AND BEING NOTIFIED OF POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF COMPANY POLICY."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""DID NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE REASONS FOR DISCHARGE. INSURANCE SALE WAS DONE BY MY TRAINING MANAGER WHILE I WAS BEING TRAINED AND CLIENT LOVED IT FOR 5 YEARS BEFORE NOT BEING SATISFIED ANYMORE WITH THE RETURNS. NOT MEETING THE FIRM'S FINANCIAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS WAS ALSO FALSE. I ALWAYS FOLLOWED AMERIPRISE'S TEMPLATES FOR THE ENTIRE 9 YEARS I WAS AT THE COMPANY OFTEN GETTING REWARDED AND PRAISED FOR THE QUALITY OF MY PLANS. THIS REASON MADE NO SENSE. AND THE PRIVACY VIOLATION WAS AN EMAIL I SENT TO A CLIENT WITH A REIT APPLICATION ATTACHED THAT HAD THE LAST 4 DIGITS OF THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNT NUMBER ON IT. AMERIPRISE HAD RECENTLY CHANGED THE PROCESS BY WHICH YOU SENT CLIENT EMAILS AND WHEN I SENT IT IN DECEMBER OF 2009 I GOT WARNED AND REMINDED THAT I NEEDED TO SEND THE INFO THE NEW WAY BUT THAT WAS IT. NOTHING ELSE WAS DONE AT THE TIME UNTIL I SAW IT SHOW UP ON MY DISCHARGE EXPLANATION. THERE WERE DEFINITELY OTHER THINGS AT WORK HERE THAT WENT BEYOND BLACK AND WHITE.""
