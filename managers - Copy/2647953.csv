  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC ADMIN RELEASES 33-9604, 34-72461; IA RELEASE 40-3862; INVESTMENT COMPANY RELEASE 40-31096, JUNE 24, 2014: THE SEC DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 8A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, SECTIONS 203(F) AND (K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940, AND SECTION 9(B) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 AGAINST DAVID J. MONTANINO. AFTER AN INVESTIGATION, THE DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT ALLEGES THAT MONTANINO AND A BUSINESS PARTNER RAISED AND LOST, OR MISAPPROPRIATED, AT LEAST $794,000 OF INVESTOR FUNDS THROUGH TWO PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERINGS. MONTANINO AND HIS BUSINESS PARTNER OPERATED THE SCHEME THROUGH AN INVESTMENT FUND THAT PURPORTED TO INVEST IN A PORTFOLIO OF OTHER INVESTMENT FUNDS TO WHICH IT ALSO SERVED AS UNREGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISER, A STATE-REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISER, AND AN INVESTMENT FUND IN THE UNREGISTERED ADVISORS SUPPOSED PORTFOLIO. SPECIFICALLY, MONTANINO DECEIVED AN ADVISORY CLIENT, WHO INVESTED IN ONE OF THE FUNDS, ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, THE MANAGEMENT OF ACCOUNT ASSETS, RISKS, LOSSES, AND LIQUIDITY. MONTANINO, WITH HIS BUSINESS PARTNER, ALSO DEVISED AND IMPLEMENTED A SCHEME TO SOLICIT INVESTORS AND ADVISE THEM TO INVEST IN A FUND SECRETLY DESIGNED TO MISAPPROPRIATE INVESTOR FUNDS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, MONTANINO PREPARED MARKETING DOCUMENTS DESCRIBING THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND EXPECTED RETURNS. THROUGH THE INVESTMENT ADVISER, ONE FUND WOULD MANAGE $300 TO $400 MILLION WITHIN ONE YEAR AND SELL THE FUND WITHIN THREE YEARS, GENERATING RETURNS OF SEVEN TO TEN TIMES OF CAPITAL. THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY CENTERED ON MONTANINO RUNNING A HIGHLY PROFITABLE INVESTMENT ADVISER, THROUGH WHICH, HE WOULD RECRUIT AND SUPERVISE INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS AND SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE MONEY. BUT MONTANINO HAD NO RELEVANT EXPERIENCE AND NO REALISTIC EXPECTATION OF IMPLEMENTING THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY. MONTANINO ALSO MISREPRESENTED HIS INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE IN A FUND'S MARKETING DOCUMENTS, FALSELY CLAIMING THAT HE HAD PROVIDED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR A CLIENT BASE WITH OVER $1 BILLION IN ASSETS AND HAD FIFTEEN YEARS OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE FOR HIGH-NET WORTH CLIENTS. DESPITE THE MISREPRESENTATIONS MADE IN THE MARKETING MATERIALS AND ALSO DURING ORAL PRESENTATIONS IN WHICH HE PARTICIPATED, MONTANINO USED FUND INVESTORS' MONEY FOR PERSONAL BENEFIT RATHER THAN TO IMPLEMENT THE SUPPOSED INVESTMENT STRATEGY. BASED ON THIS CONDUCT, MONTANINO WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECURITIES ACT SECTION 17(A), EXCHANGE ACT SECTION 10(B) AND RULE 10B-5 THEREUNDER, AND ADVISERS ACT SECTIONS 206(1), (2), AND (4) AND RULE 206(4)-8 THEREUNDER, AND WILLFULLY AIDED AND ABETTED, AND CAUSED AN INVESTMENT FUNDS'S VIOLATIONS OF SECURITIES ACT SECTION 17(A), EXCHANGE ACT SECTION 10(B) AND RULE 10B-5, AND ADVISERS ACT SECTIONS 206(1) AND (2)."",
