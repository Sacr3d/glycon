  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Schwab's internal review determined that the claim had no merit and was denied. Per the Schwab Account Agreement, Schwab does not give tax advice, but we may provide clients with general tax information and principles.  During Schwab's review of the claim, client disclosed that the tax liability incurred was due to a transaction performed at a firm outside of Schwab which was never disclosed to me. Schwab does not advise on assets held outside of Schwab.""
