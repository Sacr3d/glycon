  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE REPS ORIGINAL GOAL WAS TO KEEP THE GRANITE REEF PROPERTY AS A RENTAL WHEN HE BOUGHT HIS PRIMARY RESIDENCE IN NOVEMBER 2012.  THE PREVAILING RENTAL MARKET DID NOT SUPPORT THE MONTHLY RENTAL INCOME NEEDED TO COVER THE MONTHLY MORTGAGE HOA/CONDO FEE, THUS CREATING A SIGNIFICANT MONTHLY DEBT INCREASE TO CARRY THE PROPERTY.  THE REP CALLED WELLS FARGO BANK TO NEGOTIATE A SHORT SALE.  THE REP FOUND OUT WELLS FARGO BANK SOLD THE MORTGAGE TO FNMA AND WITH A REAL ESTATE ATTORNEY CONTINUED TO NEGOTIATE A SHORT SALE AND WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.  THE REP FOUND OUT THIS YEAR THAT THE PROPERTY SOLD IN A TRUSTEE SALE LAST JULY.  THE REP STATES  THAT THE PRIMARY METHOD OF FORECLOSURE IN AZ INVOLVES WHAT IS KNOWN AS A NON-JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE.  THIS TYPE OF FORECLOSURE DOES NOT INVOLVE COURT ACTION BUT REQUIRES NOTICE COMMONLY CALLED FORECLOSURE BY ADVERTISEMENT.  THE AZ ANTI-DEFICIENCY STATUTE WOULD PREVENT THE BANK FROM SUING IF A HOME IS LOST TO FORECLOSURE.""
