    ""Charges"" : ""I WAS CHARGED WITH A COUNT OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULT, 2C:12-1(B)(1) S817434, STEMMING FROM AN EVENT WHERE I WAS ATTACKED, UNPROVOKED, BY TWO MEN WHO WERE OUT ON PAROLE FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER (I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE ON BAIL FOR).  THE CHARGE WAS BROUGHT BY THE INDIVIDUAL WHO DIRECTLY ATTACKED ME WITH A HAMMER AND KNIFE.  I PLEAD NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF SELF DEFENSE AND I WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY IN THE VERNON MUNICIPAL COURT ON AUGUST 2, 1988.  PRIOR TO THE COURT DATE, I WAS ADVISED THAT THE INITIAL CHARGE OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULT WAS DOWNGRADED TO THE EQUIVALENT OF A DISORDERLY PERSONS OFFENSE, WHICH AGAIN, I PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO AND WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY AS WELL.  THE OTHER TWO MEN WERE FOUND GUILTY OF ASSAULT AND RETURNED TO PRISON TO SERVE OUT THEIR TERMS."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL CHARGE AGAINST ME WAS FOR AGGRAVATED ASSAULT, THE CHARGE WAS DOWNGRADED TO A MISDEMEANOR CHARGE, WHICH MY ATTORNEY IS ATTEMPTING TO HAVE THE COURT LOCATE THESE RECORDS.  DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED ALMOST 20 YEARS AGAIN, THE COURT DOES NOT KNOW IF THEY HAVE THE RECORDS.  REGARDLESS, I WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY AND WOULD NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, WHICH WAS REDUCED, ON MY U4 FORM.  THE FACT THAT THIS MATTER WAS RESOLVED IN A MUNICIPAL COURT IS EVIDENCE OF THE DOWNGRADED CHARGE.""
