MARSHALL, ACTING THROUGH HIS FIRM PROVIDED THE SUBJECT COMPANY WITH A DRAFT COPY OF A RESEARCH REPORT THAT CONTAINED PROHIBITED INFORMATION, BEFORE THE REPORT WAS PUBLISHED. MARSHALL ISSUED RESEARCH REPORT THAT FAILED TO DISCLOSE THAT HE OR A MEMBER OF HIS HOUSEHOLD HAD A FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE SECURITIES AND THE NATURE OF THE FINANCIAL INTEREST."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO REGULATE PERSONAL TRADING ACTIVITY AMONG RESEARCH ANALYSTS DID NOT ALERT THE FIRM'S STAFF TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE TRADE TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE SUBJECT RESEARCH REPORT.  FURTHERMORE, THE APPARENT PERSONAL TRADE VIOLATION WAS UNINTENTIONAL AND IN NO WAY AN ATTEMPT TO PERSONALLY BENEFIT FROM THE PROXIMITY OF THE ISSUANCE OF THE SUBJECT RESEARCH REPORT.  FIRST DALLAS SECURITIES' RESEARCH REPORTS DID NOT USE A CONVENTIONAL RATING SYSTEM OR TRADITIONAL PRICE TARGETS.  MOREOVER, DUE TO THE LIMITED DISTRIBUTION OF THE RESEARCH REPORTS AND THE SIZE OF THE FIRM, THE FIRM VIEWS ITS RESEARCH REPORTS AS HAVING HAD NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE STOCK PRICE OF A SUBJECT SECURITY.""
