  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Admin Release 34-79117, October 19, 2016:   The Securities and Exchange Commission (\""Commission\"") deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\""Exchange Act\"") against John M. Leonard (\""Respondent\"" or \""Leonard\"").   From March 2010 through June 2011, Leonard offered and sold securities in the form of limited-partnership units (\""LP units\"") issued by Quest Energy Management Group, Inc. (\""Quest\"") in a limited partnership called Permian Advanced Oil Recovery Investment Fund I, L.P. (\""PAOR\""). Leonard served as a broker in these transactions, but he was neither registered with the Commission as a broker nor associated with a Commission-registered broker.   On September 29, 2016, a final judgment was entered against Leonard, permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, in Civil Action Number 1:14-CV-185, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.   The Commission alleged, and the Court specifically found, that from January 2010 through June 2011 Leonard: (i) solicited prospective investors in person, by phone, and by email; (ii) recommended the PAOR investment to investors; (iii) negotiated transactions in PAOR LP units and closed the sales; (iv) distributed, directly and indirectly, a PAOR private placement memoranda and other offering materials; and (v) received a 10-percent commission from Quest on each PAOR LP unit sale. No registration statement was filed with the Commission regarding the PAOR LP units.   The Court found that Leonard acted as a broker in sales of PAOR LP units (or fractions thereof) to 13 investors who collectively invested more than $4 million. Leonard received $405,698 in commissions on those sales. The Court found that Leonard - while not being registered as a broker - used means of interstate commerce to effect transactions in PAOR LP units in violation of Exchange Act Section 15(a). The Court further found that $405,698 was a reasonable approximation of the ill-gotten gains causally connected to Leonard's violations, and ordered Leonard to disgorge that amount."",

  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Litigation Release 23144 / November 26, 2014: On November 20, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two principals of Quest Energy Management Group, Inc. (Quest), with conducting a fraudulent offering of preferred stock and limited partnership interests. The SEC also charged John Leonard, a salesman with acting as an unregistered broker in offering and selling the investment.  The SEC alleges that between January 2010 and May 2011, the principals, a father-son duo, used Quest, an Albany, Texas-based oil and gas company, to fraudulently offer Quest preferred stock and limited partnership units in an entity called Permian Advanced Oil Recovery Investment Fund I, LP (PAOR). Investors were told that PAOR would acquire working interests in oil and gas leases from Quest and receive revenue from those leases. With assistance from unregistered salesman John Leonard, the principals raised $4.8 million from approximately 17 investors. The PAOR offering was fraudulent on account of blatantly deceptive misstatements about Quest and PAOR. More particularly, the principals made false statements in the private placement memorandum about the financial viability of Quest; the purchase debt and liens associated with certain leases in which PAOR was acquiring an interest; the current and projected petroleum production from the leases; the use of investor funds raised in the offering; independent audits of PAOR; and foreseeable litigation against Quest and the principals. The SEC's complaint against Leonard alleges that he violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act."",
