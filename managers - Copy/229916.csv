  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Admin Release 34-80054/February 16, 2017: The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) against James P. Griffin. On July 22, 2015, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of New York (USAO) filed a criminal indictment against Griffin in United States v. Griffin, 15-cr-207 (N.D.N.Y.), alleging five counts of mail fraud, eight counts of wire fraud, and five counts of money laundering against Griffin. On July 30, 2015, the Commission filed a parallel civil action, SEC v. Griffin, 15-cv-0927 (N.D.N.Y.), naming Griffin and others as defendants. On November 25, 2015, the USAO filed a superseding indictment in United Sates v. Griffin. The Superseding Indictment charged Griffin with twenty-three separate criminal counts: 10 counts of mail fraud (pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1341); 8 counts of wire fraud (pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1343); and 5 counts of money laundering (pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1957 and 2(b)). On February 2, 2016, the Court in SEC v. Griffin stayed that case, \""pending disposition of\"" United States v. Griffin. On July 18, 2016, at the close of a seven-day trial, the jury in United States v. Griffin found Griffin guilty on all twenty-three counts of the Superseding Indictment. On July 25, 2016, the Court in SEC v. Griffin lifted its prior stay of that case, which remains pending before the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. On December 16, 2016, the Court in United States v. Griffin entered its Judgment against Griffin, which sentences him, inter alia, to 60 months imprisonment (followed by three years of supervised release), and to pay restitution of $2,153,530.93."",

  ""Allegations"" : ""This civil enforcement action concerns a series of fraudulent offerings and sales of securities, from 2007 through at least 2014, by a number of closely-related corporate entities. James P. Griffin and the other defendants fraudulently induced individual investors to purchase 54Freedom securities - i.e., its stock, promissory notes and charitable gift annuities (CGAs) - with materially false and misleading oral and written projections and promises regarding 54Freedom share price increases, stock listings, revenue projections, the safety of the securities, and 54Freedom's use of investor proceeds. Griffin created and controlled 54Freedom and orchestrated the fraud. Griffin defrauded CGA investors by, inter alia, falsely promising them that the CGAs were backed by annuities issued by \""A-rated\"" third-party insurance companies. The Complaint alleges that Griffin violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Griffin also aided and abetted the corporate entities' violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."",
