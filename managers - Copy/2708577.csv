I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD AND ATTEMPTING TO ENTER INTO A FRATERNITY ON CAMPUS.  MY PLEDGE BROTHERS AND MYSELF WERE ASSIGNED TO TAKE SOMETHING FROM THE LOCAL BOOKSTORE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE FRATERNITY HOSUSE AS PART OF OUR INITIATION. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME, MY DESIRE TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS FRATERNITY DID NOT ALLOW ME TO USE GREAT JUDGMENT.  I WAS CAUGHT STEALING A TEXTBOOK WORTH FIFTY DOLLARS. I SERVED 12 MONTHS OF SUPERVISION BY THE UNIVERSITY AND PAID A $150 FINE TO SETTLE THE OFFENSE.  I PAID THE PRICE FOR MY ACTIONS, BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS DID I EVER CONSIDER OR REALIZE THAT THIS ACT IN MY COLLEGE DAYS WOULD EFFECT MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER.""
