NUOVO INTRODUCED PEOPLE, INCLUDING MEMBER FIRM CUSTOMERS, TO A PROMOTER WHO SOLD SECURITIES OFFERED BY A COMPANY THAT PURPORTEDLY SOLD AND SERVICED GROUP MEDICAL INSURANCE THROUGH MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS OR OTHER LARGE GROUPS. INDIVIDUALS INVESTED A TOTAL OF $2.55 MILLION IN SECURITIES OFFERED BY THE COMPANY AND NUOVO PERSONALLY INVESTED $75,000 IN THE SECURITIES. NUOVO WAS PAID APPROXIMATELY $107,500 FOR REFERRING INVESTORS BUT DID NOT DISCLOSE TO POTENTIAL INVESTORS THAT HE WOULD RECEIVE COMPENSATION. NUOVO MISLED MANY INVESTORS BY SUGGESTING HE HAD PERSONALLY INVESTED BETWEEN $300,000 AND $1,000,000 AND THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY WOULD ALLOW HIM TO RETIRE EARLY. NUOVO ALSO GAVE POTENTIAL INVESTORS MISLEADING MATERIALS CREATED BY THE COMPANY THAT OVERSTATED ITS SUCCESS, FALSELY PROJECTED THE RETURN OF 100% OF PRINCIPAL IN 12 MONTHS, AND FALSELY PROJECTED THAT THE INVESTMENT WOULD PROVIDE AN ANNUAL YIELD OF 1,200%. (THE SEC HAS FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS CHARGING TWO COMPANY EXECUTIVES WITH FRAUD FOR OPERATING A PONZI SCHEME.) NUOVO FAILED TO DISCLOSE HIS ACTIVITIES TO HIS FIRM AND CONCEALED HIS ACTIVITY BY USING HIS PERSONAL EMAIL ADDRESS AND CELL PHONE NUMBER TO CONDUCT COMPANY-RELATED BUSINESS. NUOVO ALSO FALSELY STATED THAT HE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS ON COMPLIANCE FORMS HE SUBMITTED TO HIS FIRM. NUOVO SET UP AN ENTITY TO USE FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES UNRELATED TO HIS EMPLOYMENT WITH HIS FIRM INCLUDING TO CONTRACT WITH THE MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANY FOR RECEIPT OF REFERRAL FEES AND TO HOLD HIS PERSONAL COMPANY INVESTMENTS; HE ESTABLISHED BANK ACCOUNTS AND CREDIT CARDS FOR THE ENTITY THAT HE USED TO PAY FOR BUSINESS EXPENSES UNRELATED TO HIS EMPLOYMENT WITH HIS FIRM BUT DID NOT DISCLOSE THESE ACTIVITIES TO HIS FIRM. NUOVO FALSELY STATED TO THE FIRM THAT HE WAS ENGAGED IN ONLY ONE OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITY ON COMPLIANCE FORMS HE SUBMITTED TO HIS FIRM. NUOVO HELD SECURITIES ACCOUNTS AT AN OUTSIDE BROKER-DEALER HE HAD OPENED BEFORE JOINING THE FIRM BUT DID NOT DISCLOSE THOSE ACCOUNTS TO HIS MEMBER FIRM."",
