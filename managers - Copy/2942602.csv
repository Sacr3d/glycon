  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Litigation Release No. 24215, July 25, 2018: This matter involves an unlawful, serial insider trading scheme orchestrated by three financial industry professionals, in which an investment banker tipped material, nonpublic information to his father an accountant, who partnered with his friend a professional trader, Cunniffe, to exploit this information by placing highly profitable securities trades. As an investment banker at two prominent investment banks, the investment banker learned nonpublic information about future mergers and acquisitions involving clients of these investment banks. From 2010 to 2014, on at least six occasions, the investment banker tipped his father about imminent mergers or acquisitions so that his father could benefit from this valuable information, and on four of these occasions, the investment banker's father further tipped the information to Cunniffe. Cunniffe used the information to place trades in his own accounts and generated approximately $1.1 million in illicit proceeds which he shared with the father. The investment banker's father knew that because of his undeniable relationship with his son, he needed to recruit a partner who would trade in his stead to conceal his trading activity. To this end, the father approached Cunniffe, and the two men agreed that Cunniffe would trade in Cunniffe's account and then split the illicit profits. Cunniffe and the investment banker's father attempted to conceal their illegal trading and evade detection by: (a) favoring in-person meetings to discuss the scheme; (b) using coded email messages to discuss the scheme; (c) spreading trades over numerous stock options series in an attempt to avoid regulatory scrutiny; (d) buying stock options during periods when these securities were more heavily traded in order to blend into the daily volume; (e) refraining from options trading too close to the expected announcement date of a merger or acquisition; and (f) in most instances, sharing the illicit profits through cash payments. By this Complaint, the Commission charges defendant Cunniffe with illegal insider trading in violation of the federal securities laws. By knowingly or recklessly engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Cunniffe violated and, unless restrained and enjoined by the Court, will continue to violate Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."",
