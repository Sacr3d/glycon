  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MY FAMILY CAME UP FROM NJ TO VISIT ME IN SYRACUSE, NY FOR A BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION AT AN ESTABLISHMENT FORMALLY CALLED OHM ON SOUTH FRANKLIN ST. IN THE CITY OF SYRACUSE. AN ALTERCATION HAD OCCURRED WHEN ONE OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS WAS ASSAULTED BY 2 OTHER PATRONS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT. WHEN THIS WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION I RUSHED OVER TO RESTORE ORDER, WHEN 2 OFFICERS IN PLAIN CLOTHING (WHOM DID NOT IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES) AGGRESSIVELY PUT THEIR HANDS ON ME. GIVEN THE ISSUE AT HAND I TOOK PRECAUTION IN DEFENDING MYSELF AT THAT POINT OF THE MATTER.  THIS IN FULL IS EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPEN! A NIGHT THAT REALLY GOT OUT OF CONTROL.""
