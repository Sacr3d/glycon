  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ACCORDING TO OUR RECORDS, THE FA SPOKE WITH THE CLIENT ON OCTOBER 17, 2008 AT WHICH TIME HE RECEIVED THE CLIENT'S AUTHORIZATION TO ADD $43,000.00 TO THE HARTFORD ANNUITY.  THE TRANSACTION WAS REFLECTED ON THE OCTOBER 2008 ACCOUNT STATEMENT.  IN ADDITION, THE CLIENT RECEIVED A CONFIRMATION FROM HARTFORD LIFE WHICH REFLECTED THE $43,000.00 BEING ADDED TO THE CONTRACT.  IT IS UNDERSTOOD THE CLIENT HAS CLAIMED THE $43,000.00 WAS TO COME FROM ANOTHER HARTFORD ANNUITY CONTRACT; HOWEVER, THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THAT ANNUITY (AS REFLECTED ON THE SEPTEMBER 2008 ACCOUNT STATEMENT) WAS $32,920.59 - NOT $43,000.00.  BASED ON OUR REVIEW, IT IS OUR OPINION THE TRANSACTION WAS COMPLETED WITH THE CLIENT'S KNOWLEDGE AND AUTHORIZATION.  IN ADDITION, THE TRANSACTION WAS EVIDENCED THROUGH ACCOUNT STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THROUGH THE CONFIRMATION RECEIVED FROM HARTFORD LIFE.  AS A RESULT OF OUR REVIEW, WE WILL BE MAKING NO ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ACCOUNT IN REGARDING TO THIS MATTER.""
