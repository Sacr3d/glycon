  ""Allegations"" : ""Plaintiff-Trustee claims that a former advisor representative, Marty Barnes, defrauded his former mother-in-law (now deceased) in connection with his recommendation that she invest in a construction/development company, Triton, and/or that he negligently misrepresented the risks associated with that investment.
