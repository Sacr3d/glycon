  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I was charged and arrested not so much for smoking pot, but because my friend has a HUGE mouth and started yelling and calling the cops on scene every obscenity in the book.  So naturally the cops responded in kind and something that should have just been a PTA at best snowballed into a felony and two misdemeanors because they couldn't go after the load mouth insulting them so next best thing was me.""
