  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Registered Rep of record on the accounts, also named in this complaint, was selling products away from the firm. His office was visited on a monthly basis. I never had the ability to review any paperwork from these clients. Only 1 of the clients had any business with the firm. Registered Rep of record filed for bankruptcy in order avoid any financial liability. Neither the firm nor I had any knowledge of the transactions, despite visiting and inspecting the office on a regular basis.  The firm and I both strongly deny any allegation of failure to supervise in this matter.""
