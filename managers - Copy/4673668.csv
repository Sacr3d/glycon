  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE TAX SITUATION WAS CREATED BY A STUPID POWER PLAY BETWEEN ME AND MY HUSBAND. I TOLD HIM IF HE DIDN'T FILE THE TAXES, THEY WEREN'T GETTING FILED.  I BELIEVE IT WAS FOR THE TAX YEAR 1993, ONCE HE DIDN'T FILE, I WASN'T SURE HOW TO GO ABOUT FILING SO WE DID NOTHING. WE DID NOT FILE AGAIN IN 1994 OR 1995. WE WERE CONTACTED BY THE IRS AND COOPERATED WITH THEM TO ESTABLISH A PAYMENT PLAN WHICH WE HAVE KEPT SINCE 1997 WHEN WE STARTED WITH THEM. WE SHOULD BE DONE PAYING THEM OFF IN THE NEXT 4-6 MONTHS (JULY-AUGUST 2004).""
