  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I deny the allegations and believe them to be without merit or fact.  I was not the broker of record at the time the investment in question was purchased. I did not recommend or solicit the client to purchase the product.  The crux of the matter is  a disagreement between beneficiaries and who the inheritor of an annuity payout would be. Again, this was not a product that was solicited by me and the drop in value is a result of the extreme market volatility.  This matter was settled for business reasons to avoid the cost And uncertainties of the litigation forum.""
