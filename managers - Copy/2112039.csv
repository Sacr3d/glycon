CUSTOMER WAS AN EXPERIENCED INVESTOR, WHO WANTED TO ACHIEVE GROWTH WITH THESE FUNDS AND UNDERSTOOD ASSOCIATED RISKS TO MARKET VALUE OF INVESTMENT. SINCE THE MARKET HAS DECLINED, CUSTOMER IS NOW SUGGESTING THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO INVEST IN A GROWTH-STYLE PORTFOLIO. THIS IS NOT TRUE AND IS UNSUPPORTED BY ALL BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS. FURTHER, CUSTOMER HAS NOT INCURRED AND WILL NOT INCUR ANY REALIZED \""LOSS\"" ON INVESTMENT UNLESS SHE DECIDES TO LIQUIDATE THIS INVESTMENT EARLY AND WITHDRAW FUNDS FROM THE CONTRACT.""
