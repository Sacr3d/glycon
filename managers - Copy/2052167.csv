  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON DECEMBER 6, 2012, I WAS DISCHARGED FROM MERRILL LYNCH FOR \""PUBLICATION OF UNAPPROVED ADVERTISING\"". OVER THE PREVIOUS MONTHS, I HAD BEEN BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP WITH DEEP WOOD ESTATES, AN \""ASSISTED LIVING\"" RETIREMENT HOME IN LEXINGTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.  ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS, DEEP WOOD ESTATES INVITED ME TO BE A GUEST SPEAKER TO DISCUSS SOCIAL SECURITY & ESTATE PLANNING.  ALL THREE EVENTS WERE AUTHORIZED BY MY COMPLIANCE OFFICER AT MERRILL LYNCH.  IN NOVEMBER OF 2012, I WAS PHONED BY THE MANAGER OF THE DEEP WOOD ESTATES REQUESTING IF I WOULD COME AND SING CHRISTMAS CAROLS TO THE RESIDENTS IN DECEMBER.  BEFORE THE CONVERSATION ENDED, I ASKED THE MANAGER IF ANY OF THE RESIDENTS HAD EVER REQUESTED A PRIVATE MEETING WITH ME FROM THE PRIOR SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS.  HIS REPLY WAS THAT HE DID NOT KNOW HOWEVER HE WOULD MENTION IT IN THEIR UPCOMING NEWSLETTER.  I SAID I WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE RESIDENTS MAY HAVE AND IF THEY WERE INTERESTED, TO NOTIFY THE DEEP WOOD ESTATES' MANAGEMENT TO ARRANGE THE MEETING.  WITH THAT, WE ENDED THE CALL.    A COUPLE WEEKS LATER, I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM THE MANAGER OF DEEP WOOD ESTATES.  ATTACHED WAS A COPY OF THEIR INTERNAL NEWSLETTER.  IN THAT NEWSLETTER, WAS A PARAGRAPH PERTAINING TO OUR EARLIER DISCUSSION ABOUT MY WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH THE RESIDENTS PRIVATELY.  I DIDN'T GIVE IT A SECOND THOUGHT.  ANOTHER WEEK WENT BY WHEN I WAS SUMMONED TO MY COMPLIANCE OFFICE.  THEY PLACED THE NEWSLETTER IN FRONT OF ME AND ASKED ME TO EXPLAIN.  I EXPLAINED IT AS I HAVE IN THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH, AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE NEWSLETTER WAS CONSIDERED ADVERTISING AND THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN CLEARED THROUGH COMPLIANCE.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE MATTER HAD BEEN ESCALATED TO A HIGHER AUTHORITY WITHIN MERRILL LYNCH.  SEVERAL HOURS LATER, I WAS INFORMED THAT I WAS BEING TERMINATED FOR PUBLICATION OF UNAPPROVED ADVERTISING.  I HAVE ATTACHED A COPY OF THAT NEWS LETTER FOR YOUR REVIEW. (I WANT TO PREFACE I DID NOT PAY FOR THIS, REQUEST THIS OR WRITE IT.  THIS WAS TOTALLY INITIATED AND SCRIPTED BY MANAGEMENT OF DEEP WOOD ESTATES).     CONT:               REGARDING QUESTION 2,  THE PURPOSE FOR THE UNAPPROVED ADVERTISING/NEWSLETTER WAS TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE RESIDENTS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A PERSONAL MEETING WITH ME.  REGARDING QUESTIONS 3,  AT NO TIME WAS THE UNAPPROVED ADVERTISING USED FOR AN UNAPPROVED/UNDISCLOSED OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITY.  I ATTEST TO THE ABOVE STATEMENT AS TRUE AND ACCURATE.  SINCERELY,     JON MICHAELS SATURDAY, JANUARY 19, 2013""

THE ATTACHMENT IS COPY OF THE FINRA LETTER WITH FULL EXPLANATION.   REGARDING THE INCIDENT DATED APRIL OF 1993,   I WAS WORKING FOR A COMPANY CALLED UNIVERSAL WIRELESS IN THE 2ND HALF OF 1992 SELLING LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS IN A WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS VENTURE.  I WAS INFORMED BY THE OWNERS THAT THE PROGRAM WAS FOR ACCREDITED INVESTORS AND WAS ASSURED BY THE PRINCIPALS THAT ALL LICENSES FOR ALL STATES WERE SECURED.  SHORTLY AFTER BEGINNING EMPLOYMENT, I FOUND I DID NOT HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THE COMPANY SO  I TERMINATED MY EMPLOYMENT AS OF NOVEMBER, 1992 AND MOVED TO NASHVILLE, TN   THAT FOLLOWING DECEMBER. ( DECEMBER, 23RD TO BE EXACT.) I HAD COMPLETELY REMOVED MYSELF FROM UNIVERSAL WIRELESS AND HAD NO FUTURE COMMUNICATION WITH THAT COMPANY.  I WAS NOT AWARE THAT ANY COMPLAINT HAD BEEN FILED WITH MY NAME UNTIL I RE-ENTERED THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN 2011. IT WAS THEN I WAS TOLD THERE WAS A \""DING\"" ON MY U4.    MERRILL LYNCH INVESTIGATED IT AND INFORMED ME THAT THE STATE OF WISCONSIN HAD ISSUED A CEASE AND DESIST LETTER BACK IN 1993.   I GUESS THE WIRELESS PROGRAM WAS HAD NOT BEEN REGISTERED BACK IN 1992 AND I HAD CONTACTED SOMEONE IN THAT STATE.    I HAVE NO OTHER INFORMATION FROM THAT TIME PERIOD AND HAD NOT BEEN IN THE INDUSTRY UNTIL BECOMING AN FA FOR ML.  I ATTEST TO THE ABOVE BEING 100% ACCURATE AND COMPLETE TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE.
