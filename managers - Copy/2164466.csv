  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I was not the broker who sold the variable annuity to this client.  The client purchased the product from a broker-dealer firm offering nationwide products.  Current statements indicate that the value of this product exceeds the client's basis.   With respect to the exchange-traded product, the client expressly directed me to purchase aggressive, high volatility investments for his account. These are high risk investments.  Therefore, I provided the client extensive disclosures regarding the risk, which he acknowledged in writing, prior to the pruchase of this product.""
