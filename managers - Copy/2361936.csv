  ""Broker Comment"" : ""FA HAS INDICATED THAT THE CLIENT DID PROVIDE INSTRUCTIONS TO LIQUIDATE HIS ANNUITY ON OCTOBER 7, 2008 AND AT THAT TIME, THE FA BELIEVED NO ADDITIONAL PAPERWORK WAS NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE LIQUIDATION.  FA HAS STATED HE LATER LEARNED THERE WAS ADDITIONAL PAPERWORK NEEDED AND IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THE PAPERWORK WAS MAILED TO THE CLIENT.  ACCORDING TO THE CLIENT'S LETTER, THE CLIENT INDICATES HE RETURNED THE PAPERWORK TO THE FA'S OFFICE ON OCTOBER 13, 2008 AND OUR RECORDS REFLECT THE LIQUIDATION WAS PROCESSED AT THAT TIME.  SINCE THERE WAS A MISCOMMUNICATION WE MADE AN OFFER TO THE CLIENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $431.67 WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE OF THE OCTOBER 7 PRICE VERSUS THE PRICE HE RECEIVED FROM THE SELL.  CLIENT ACCEPTED OUR OFFER AND A CHECK IN THE AMOUNT OF $431.67 WAS SENT TO HIM.""
