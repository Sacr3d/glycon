  ""Broker Comment"" : ""NINE DAYS AFTER THE SALE OF HIS STOCK, [CUSTPOMER] ALLEGED THAT IT WAS UNAUTHORIZED.  SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE CUSTOMER'S SELL ORDER, THE STOCK PRICE ROSE DUE TO A TAKEOVER BID. PRIOR TO THE COMPLAINT, THE FIRM RECEIVED A LETTER FROM [CUSTOMER] STATING THAT ON TRADE DATE, TWO REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES CONFIRMED THE SELL ORDER.  IN ADDITION, [CUSTOMER] MENTIONED IN A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH ME, SUBSEQUENT TO THE STOCK'S SUDDEN RISE IN PRICE, THAT HE REGRETTED HIS DECISION TO SELL IT.  INCIDENTLY, DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD ANOTHER STOCK, WHICH THIS CUSTOMER SOLD, DECLINED IN PRICE.  HE DID NOT MAKE ANY CLAIMS CONCERNING THE SALE OF THIS STOCK.  AGAINST THE ADVICE OF THE BRANCH OFFICE MANAGER, GRUNTAL & CO. ADJUSTED THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNT BY REPLACING THE SHARES OF THE STOCK IN QUESTION AT A LOSS TO THE FIRM OF $16,500.""
