  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON 06/25/01 CUSTOMER INVESTED $100K IN A WORLDCOM CORP. BOND.  THIS CLIENT HAS YEARS OF EXPERIENCE INVESTING IN CORPORATE BONDS AND THIS INVESTMENT WAS LESS THAN 6% OF HIS LIQUID ASSETS.  THE BOND WAS RATED INVESTMENT GRADE AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE (A3 MOODYS / BBB+ S&P) AND MAINTAINED THIS RATING UP UNTIL THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS $9 BILLION ACCOUNTING SCANDAL AND BANKRUPTCY FILING CAUSING AN IMMEDIATE DROP IN VALUE.  THERE WAS NO WAY OF FORESEEING THIS.  DISCUSSED WITH CLIENT SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT SELLING THE BOND IN THE HIGH FIFTIES BUT INSTEAD HE WANTED TO WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE HE DID NOT FEEL THE COMPANY WOULD GO OUT OF BUSINESS.""
