  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNT RECORDS WILL DOCUMENT THAT NONE OF THESE CLAIMS HAVE ANY VALIDITY. I WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE FIRM DURING THE TIME THIS CLIENT ALLEGES THE UNAUTHORIZED TRADING OCCURRED. I LEFT MORGAN STANLEY IN JULY OF 2000. RECORDS WILL SHOW THAT THIS CLIENT HAD WITHDRAWN THE ENTIRE BALANCE OF HIS ACCOUNT JUST MONTHS BEFORE WITH SUBSTANTIAL GAINS BEFORE THE MARKET COULD HAVE CAUSED THE SUGGESTED DAMAGE. THE SPECIFIC INSTANCE INVOLVING QUALCOM WAS AN IPO THAT THE CLIENT PARTICIPATED IN, BUT DID NOT GET ALL OF THE SHARES HE INITIALLY REQUESTED. HE UNDERSTOOD THIS AT THAT TIME, BECAUSE THIS CLIENT PARTICIPATED IN IPOS QUITE FREQUENTLY AND WAS VERY MUCH AWARE OF THE ALLOCATION PROCESS REGARDING THEM.""
