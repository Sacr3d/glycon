  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Bonilla consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he recommended that his customers invest in securities without having a reasonable basis to believe those investments were suitable. The findings stated that Bonilla recommended investments in a mutual fund created for customers of his member firm. Bonilla did not perform reasonable diligence on the fund prior to recommending it to customers. Bonilla could describe little about the fund's underlying holdings, beyond that some of the holdings were midstream energy companies. Bonilla did not know how the fund paid its monthly distributions or what, if any, diligence his firm performed on the fund or its holdings prior to offering shares of the funds to customers. Without sufficient understanding of these fundamental features or risks of the fund, Bonilla recommended that his customers collectively invest over $250,000 in the fund, for which he received $4,355.72 in commissions. The fund's net asset value declined by more than 40%. Bonilla also recommended illiquid investments in a limited partnership sold to customers of his firm. Bonilla did not perform reasonable diligence on the partnership prior to recommending the investment to customers. Bonilla did not know how the partnership generated funds to pay investors monthly distributions or how the price of the common units reflected on customer account statements were calculated. Bonilla did not real the full prospectus nor did he review the partnership's financial statements. Without a sufficient understanding of fundamental features and risks of the partnership, Bonilla recommended that his customers collectively invest over $650,000 in the partnership, for which he received $18,061.31 in commissions. Later, the partnership notified its common unit holders that it was suspending distributions until further notice."",
