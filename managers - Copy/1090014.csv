  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Some time around May 2017, Mr. Perros received a letter from Citicorp offering him a deal where if he paid half of his approximate $10,400 debt to the firm, Citicorp would in turn relieve him of the entire amount.  Because Citicorp reached out to him and he did not initiate the transaction, Mr. Perros did not consider this a compromise and thus never disclosed it.""
