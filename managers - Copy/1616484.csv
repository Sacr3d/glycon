  ""Broker Comment"" : ""NOT PROVIDED THERE ARE NO ALLEGATIONS OF UNAUTHORIZED TRADING AGAINST ME WITHING CUSTOMER'S COMPLAINT.  I THINK CUSTOMER IS SPEAKING OR WRITING ON BEHALF OF RICHARD BODLEY (SEGUACHE CO) WHEN HE MENTIONS UNAUTHORIZED TRADING IN THE COMPLAINTS. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE BOUGHT SHARES OF D.G. JEWELLERY THROUGH ME WHEN I WORKED FOR JOSEPH DILLON & CO.  HOW JOSEPH DILLON & CO COULD AMEND MY U-4 TO RELFECT UNAUTHORIZED TRADING IS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING ESPECIALLY WHEN THE COMPLAINT IS CLEARLY OUTLINING HOW JOSEPH DILLON & CO IS POSSIBLY CIRCUMVENTING PENNY STOCK DISCLOSURE RULES.  WHETHER OR NOT THE FIRM WAS AVOIDING PENNY STOCK DISCLOSURE LAWS, I`M NOT REALLY SURE.""
