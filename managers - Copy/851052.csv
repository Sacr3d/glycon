I STILL CLAIM I DID NOTHING WRONG HERE.  CIGNA OFFERED TO BUY BACK ALL OF THE INVESTMENTS INCLUDING A MUTUAL FUND AT ORIGINAL PRICE PLUS CLAIMANTS COULD KEEP ALL INCOME AND CASH FLOW EARNED.  THE CLAIMANT REFUSED THIS OFFER.  THAT BEING THE CASE I CANNOT HELP BUT BELIEVE I DID ANYTHING WRONG, OTHERWISE WHY DIDN`T THEY ACCEPT THE OFFER.  I TRULY I BELIEVE I WOULD HAVE WON IF THE CASE WENT TO ARBITRATION BUT CIGNA WOULD HAVE SPENT MORE THAN $23,000 IN COSTS.""
