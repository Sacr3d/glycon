  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This action is the result of an attempt by a creditor to file a garnishment of wages against me. I am protecting myself as the garnishment amount was much more than I could afford. I attempted to work with this creditor and they would not cooperate. This is an account that was a judgment from a period of time when my wife became permanently disabled and lost her income. I was attempting to work through everything as best I could but the garnishment forced me to make this decision.""
