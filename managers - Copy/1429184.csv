  ""Type"" : ""Compromise"",
  ""Disposition"" : ""Satisfied/Released"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This short sale was caused by a hardship from the builder who walked off in the middle of building this home in late 2006 as he saw the financial crisis coming. That caused me to use savings to finish construction which coupled with the financial crisis devastated my business in 2008-2012. In addition I had to leave my company (Hartford) after 10 years because they shut down the distribution of variable annuities in 2009. The combination of these three things plus the terrible housing market in South Florida during this time led me to having to short sale the property.""
