  ""Allegations"" : ""WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, MCQUIRE CONSENTED TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT HE FAILED TO NOTIFY HIS MEMBER FIRM OF A CUSTOMER COMPLAINT AND FURTHER SETTLED THE COMPLAINT THROUGH A PAYMENT OF $2,800 WITHOUT THE AUTHORIZATION OR APPROVAL OF HIS FIRM. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT MCQUIRE'S CUSTOMER COMPLETED A VARIABLE ANNUITY APPLICATION AND THE ANNUITY WAS PURCHASED WITHOUT AN INCOME RIDER REQUESTED BY THE CUSTOMER. MCQUIRE CONTACTED THE INSURANCE COMPANY REGARDING THE RIDER, BUT WAS TOLD THAT A NEW APPLICATION WOULD HAVE TO BE COMPLETED AND THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT WOULD NEED TO BE SURRENDERED. THE CUSTOMER ADVISED MCQUIRE THAT SHE WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THAT SOLUTION. THE CUSTOMER SENT MCQUIRE A LETTER ADDRESSED TO MCQUIRE'S FATHER'S ADDRESS THAT ASKED FOR $2,800 IN COMPENSATION IN EXCHANGE FOR GIVING MCQUIRE COMPLETE INDEMNITY. MCQUIRE'S FATHER DRAFTED A CHECK IN THE AMOUNT OF $2,800 PAYABLE TO THE CUSTOMER AND FORWARDED THE CHECK TO HER. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT MCQUIRE'S FIRM'S PROCEDURES REQUIRE ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO PROMPTLY NOTIFY THEIR SUPERVISOR WHEN AND IF THEY RECEIVE A COMPLAINT FROM A CUSTOMER AND WHETHER OR NOT IT IS ORAL OR IN WRITING. FIRM REPRESENTATIVES ARE PROHIBITED FROM DISCUSSING THE POSSIBLE RESOLUTION OF ANY COMPLAINT WITH THE CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD-PARTY. THE FIRM PROHIBITS ITS REPRESENTATIVES FROM OFFERING OR PAYING ANY RESTITUTION TO A CUSTOMER AND CANNOT DISCUSS WITH OR PROVIDE INFORMATION TO ANY OUTSIDE PARTY ABOUT A CUSTOMER ACCOUNT. MCQUIRE FAILED TO DISCLOSE TO THE FIRM THAT THE CUSTOMER HAD EXPRESSED DISSATISFACTION WITH THE ANNUITY, SPECIFICALLY THE FAILURE TO INCLUDE THE INCOME RIDER. MCQUIRE FURTHER FAILED TO DISCLOSE TO THE FIRM THAT THE CUSTOMER PROPOSED A SETTLEMENT, THAT HE DISCUSSED THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT WITH HIS FATHER AND THAT HIS FATHER HAD PROVIDED THE CUSTOMER WITH A CHECK IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RELEASE."",
