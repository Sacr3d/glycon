  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I LEFT VALIC IN MARCH 2003 AND JOINED NORTH ATLANTIC RETIREMENT SERVICES. AFTER JOINING THEM, 12 OF MY FORMER CLIENTS FOLLOWED ME AND TRANSFERRED THEIR ACCOUNTS. VALIC SUBSEQUENTLY SUED FOR NON COMPETE AND A HEARING WAS HELD IN JUNE AND JULY 2003. IN JANUARY 2004, THE JUDGE ORDERED THE NON COMPETE WAS NOT VALID BUT LET STAND IN FAVOR OF VALIC STATING THAT OUR MEMORY WAS A TRADE SECRET THAT WE USED TO SOLICIT CLIENTS TO TRANSFER ASSETS TO THE NEW FIRM AND HE FOUND THAT THEY WERE ENTITLED TO DAMAGES IN THE AMOUNT OF $94,362.00. NOVEMBER 2007, TRIAL WAS HELD AND THE JUDGE RULED IN DECEMBER 2007 FOR VALIC AND AWARDED THEM DAMAGES TO BE PAID BY ME IN THE AMOUNT OF $94,632.  IN JANUARY 2008 MR. LATUSZEWSKI AND MR. ROGAN APPEALED THE DAMAGES BUT I DROPPED OUT OF THE CASE.  I HAD NOT HEARD FROM, BEEN NOTIFIED, NOR SERVED ANY PAPERS, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR PAYMENT FROM VALIC UNTIL JUNE 7, 2011.""
