  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Per a written notice from client to not contact previous advisor firm made it impossible to determine cost basis and deferred tax status of previous brokerage account tax loss harvesting practices. Client was made aware of tax consequences, however we did not know the amount at the time of liquidation nor for eight months after the transaction.  Several recorded calls with previous firm requesting the information and signed documents in regards to this transaction show the client was made aware of appropriate and discounted sales loads with all available breakpoints included to provide the lowest available investment costs over time.  Although the client may not fully understand, I stand by the financial plan built and believe the client is in a better financial position after these transactions. Client requests we pay entire tax bill including taxes owed from withdrawals at previous firm.""
