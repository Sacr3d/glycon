  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In May 2009, Chase terminated my employment for following a directive from my Branch Manager, District Manager and Business Banker.  Management told me and the other Bankers that, due to a system wide upgrade, business checking accounts were inadvertently  delinked from business savings accounts. We were further instructed to access the Business Accounts and correct the system glitch by clicking a box to relink the accounts. After we did what we were told, myself and four others were terminated for relinking Business Checking to Business Savings without each customer's consent.""
