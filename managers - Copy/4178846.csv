  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MY DAUGHTER SARAH ANNE BOWMAN WAS KEPT FROM ME FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF HER LIFE AFTER HER MOTHER AND I WERE DIVORCED. I DID NOT PAY CHILD SUPPORT TO HER MOTHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT LET ME SEE HER. AFTER MANY YEARS, I STARTED TO SEE MY DAUGHTER AGAIN. I ALSO REALIZED THAT NOT PAYING SUPPORT TO MY EX-WIFE ALL THOSE YEARS WAS WRONG. I THEN VOLUNTARILY WENT TO COURT TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT THAT I OWED MY EX-WIFE. I HAVE BEEN PAYING ON THOSE ARREARAGES EVERY MONTH SINCE OCTOBER 1992. THE AMOUNT ON MY CREDIT FILE IS NOT ACCURATE. IT KEEPS CALCULATING INTEREST AND DOES NOT SHOW ANY PAYMENTS BEING MADE. THE CORRECT BALANCE ON THE CHILD SUPPORT ARREARAGES IS APPROXIMATELY $13,500.""
