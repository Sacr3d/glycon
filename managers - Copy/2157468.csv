  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE [CUSTOMERS] CLAIM AROSE OUT OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR THROUGH NO FAULT ON MR. WINTON'S PART. THE [CUSTOMERS'] ACCOUNTS WERE ASSIGNED TO MR. WINTON BY A TEXAS BRANCH ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONLY REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE IN THE OFFICE REGISTERED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, THE CLIENT?S DOMICILE.  THIS WAS DONE WITHOUT MR. WINTON'S KNOWLEDGE.  [CUSTOMERS] TRANSFERRED ACCOUNTS AWAY FROM PAINEWEBBER UPON THE RESIGNATION OF THEIR PRIOR REPRESENTATIVE.  MR. WINTON MOVED TO A DIFFERENT OFFICE IN JULY 2001. [CUSTOMER] REALIZED AFTER THE TRANSFER, THAT THE INVESTMENTS IN SAID ACCOUNTS WERE NON-TRANSFERABLE AND FAXED A LETTER OF AUTHORIZATION TO MR. WINTONS PREVIOUS OFFICE UPON INSTRUCTION FROM AN UN-NAMED ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT.  MR. WINTON HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONVERSATION NOR THE SUBSEQUENT FAX SENT TO THE OFFICE.  WHEN [CUSTOMER] REALIZED THAT THE INVESTMENTS WERE STILL NOT SOLD SEVERAL WEEKS LATER, HE ADVISED A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE RECEIVING FIRM TO CONTACT MR. WINTON.  MR. WINTON REQUESTED TO SPEAK TO ONLY [CUSTOMERS] CONCERNING THE ACCOUNTS, SINCE THERE WAS NO POWER OF ATTORNEY ON FILE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL.  WHEN COMMUNICATION FINALLY CAME FROM [CUSTOMER], THE INVESTMENT WAS LIQUIDATED AND TRANSFERRED.   [CUSTOMER] REQUESTED CREDIT FOR THE DECREASE IN INVESTMENT VALUE AND SINCE THE BRANCH HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE FAX TO THE PREVIOUS OFFICE, THE REQUEST WAS DENIED.  AFTER INVESTIGATION THE FAX COPY OF THE REQUEST WAS FOUND AND AN OFFER WAS MADE TO THE CLIENT IN THE AMOUNT OF THE AWARD.  THE CLIENT CHOSE TO SEEK ARBITRATION IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A LARGER SETTLEMENT.  HE WAS AWARDED THE SAME AMOUNT OFFERED BY THE FIRM.""
