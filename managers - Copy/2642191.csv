  ""Broker Comment"" : ""SHORTLY AFTER THE REGISTERED REP BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH BFCFS, THE FIRM PROHIBITED THE REP FROM RECOMMENDING CALENDAR SPREAD TRANSACTIONS (AN OPTIONS STRATEGY THE REP HAD APPARENTLY RECOMMENDED TO SOME OF HIS CLIENTS). THE REP WAS VERBALLY ADVISED OF THIS PROHIBITIONS, AND ABIDED BY IT THEREAFTER.  IN ITS CONFIRMING LETTER, HOWEVER, BFCFS INADVERTENTLY WROTE THAT THE REP WAS PROHIBITED FROM RECOMMENDING ANY OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS.  IT WAS NEVER INTENDED THAT THE REP WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM RECOMMENDING OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS OTHER THAN CALENDAR SPREADS. BFCFS AND MINEART TAKE THEIR RESPONSIBLITIES TO THE NASD VERY SERIOUSLY. IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS MATTER, NASD PERSONNEL HAVE COMMENTED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT BFCFS AND MINEART WERE VERY COOPERATIVE AND FORTHRIGHT.""
