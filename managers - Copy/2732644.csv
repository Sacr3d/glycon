  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE HEIRS OF THE DECEASED CLIENTS ACCEPTED THE FIRM'S OFFER OF $19114.28 AS AN ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE DECEASED CLIENT'S PURCHASE AND SUBSEQUENT ANNUITIZATION OF THEIR FIXED ANNUITY. REP'S STATEMENT: DURING THE FIRST MEETING WITH CUSTOMERS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ONE OF THEIR GOALS WAS TO HAVE ALL FINANCIAL RECORDS AND INVESTMENTS WITH ONE PERSON TO SIMPLIFY THEIR FINANCES; DURING SAME MEETING I DISCOVERED A FIXED ANNUITY WHICH THEY DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD. I CALLED THE COMPANY TO GET THE DETAILS AND FOUND OUT THE INTEREST RATE THEY WERE GETTING, HOW MUCH MONEY WAS IN THE PLAN AND HOW OLD THE ANNUITY WAS.  IN LOOKING AT THEIR COMPLETE FINANCIAL PICTURE I EXPLAINED THAT THEY COULD GET APPROXIMATELY A 1% HIGHER RATE OF RETURN BY EXCHANGING THEIR EXISTING ANNUITY TO AN AMERICAN EXPRESS FIXED ANNUITY. I EXPLAINED THAT THERE WOULD BE A NEW SET OF SURRENDER CHARGES BUT THAT THEY COULD TAKE OUT A PORTION OF THE ANNUITY EVERY MONTH WITHOUT PENALTY. I ALSO EXPLAINED THAT IF THEY WANTED THEY COULD SIMPLY TAKE THE ANNUITY THEY HAD AND SIMPLY CASH IT OUT AND PUT THE MONEY IN A CASH ACCOUNT AND SPEND IT AS THEY WISH. THE CUSTOMERS DIDN'T FEEL THEY NEEDED THE MONEY AND LIKED THE IDEA OF A FIXED RATE OF RETURN AND JUST TAKING A PORTION OUT OF THE ANNUITY EVERY MONTH WITHOUT PENALTY. I EXPLAINED ANNUITIZING TO THEM BUT THEY DID NOT WANT TO DO THAT. I CONTINUED WORKING WITH THEM WHILE I WAS EMPLOYED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS AND LISTENED TO THEIR NEEDS AND ADMINISTERED THEIR WISHES. THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR WHO TOOK OVER THE ACCOUNT AFTER I LEFT AMERICAN EXPRESS ANNUITIZED THE PLAN AND BOTH CUSTOMERS DIED SHORTLY AFTER. APPARENTLY THE HEIRS OF THE DECEASED RAISED CONCERNS THROUGH THE STATE OF MINNESOTA REGARDING THE ANNUITIZATION OPTION CHOSEN BY THEIR DECEASED RELATIVES. I WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PLAN BEING ANNUITIZED.""
