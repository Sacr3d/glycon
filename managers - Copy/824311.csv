  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I PURCHASED A HOME IN ARIZONA WITH MY SON. AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE MY WIFE AND I WERE PLANNING OUR RETIREMENT. MY SON AND I WERE GOING TO LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE SINCE IT HAD 5 BEDROOMS AND 3 BATHS AND PLENTY OF ROOM FOR ALL OF US. UNFORTUNATELY SHORTLY AFTER THE PURCHASE THE ECONOMY WENT DOWN AND I WAS UNABLE TO SELL SOME OF MY OTHER REAL ESTATE AND MY SON ALSO LOST HIS JOB. HE ENDED UP GETTING A DIVORCE AND COULD NO LONGER PAY HIS BILLS. HE USED THE LINE OF CREDIT WITH BANK OF AMERICA TO LIVE ON AND PAY EXPENSES THINKING THAT THE ECONOMY WAS GOING TO GET BETTER. I ENDED UP WITH A [REDACTED] AND COULD NO LONGER MAKE THE PAYMENTS FOR HIM SO I CONTACTED THE BANK AND THEY SUGGESTED A SETTLEMENT.""
