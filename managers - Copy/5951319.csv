  ""Firm Name"" : ""THE STUTLAND VOLATILITY GROUP, LLC"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""VIOLATION OF THE FIRM'S WRITTEN POLICY ON REPORTING OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AS REQUIRED BY THE FIRM'S SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES AND CODE OF ETHICS WHICH REQUIRES, IN PART, TO NOTIFY THE FIRM'S CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER OF THE NATURE AND EXPANSION OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY ACTIVITIES WITH HIS OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT WITH ANOTHER INVESTMENT ADVISORY FIRM."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The Stutland Volatility Group (\""SVG\"") incorrectly states that I violated the firm's written policy on reporting outside employment activities by providing services to another investment adviser that were outside of the narrow scope of allowed business. Additionally, SVG incorrectly states that my termination type was \""Discharged\"" when in fact I resigned.  The Chief Compliance Officer of The Stutland Volatility Group (\""SVG\"") and KKM Financial (\""KKM\"") was the same person until June 1, 2015. The two firms shared office space (literally the same 15 foot by 10 foot room), and SVG's CCO, KKM's CEO, and myself were in direct, daily contact with each other.  I was employed by SVG, which was the sub-adviser to KKM's two mutual funds, the Armor Funds. I was registered on both firms' ADVs and my Series 3 license was registered at both firms as well. Additionally, I owned a trivial amount of equity in KKM (0.50%). As Chief Compliance Officer of both firms (until June 1, 2015), Mr. Stutland was the architect of the intertwined structure of SVG and KKM, including the suggestion that I become a minority stakeholder in KKM. SVG's CCO invited KKM's CEO to establish KKM's office inside of SVG's. Furthermore, SVG's CCO personally filed all documents to register my Series 3 license with both SVG and KKM.  Furthermore, in SVG's November 2015 ADV, I am still listed as a part of SVG despite having resigned on July 10, 2015. The ADV also states that I am a registered representative and principle of KKM and that this does not create a conflict of interest. The mis-statements in SVG's ADV attest to SVG's extreme state of disorder and sloppy compliance policies.  While I was employed at SVG, I was never given, written or verbally, a definition of the scope within which I was to operate as a registered representative of KKM. Being that I was registered as an investment adviser representative and principle of KKM asked me if he could list me on KKM's website (kkmfinancial.com) as such. If my biography on KKM's website could be interpreted to indicate that I was engaged in other actives with KKM, it is due to either a loose interpretation, sloppy writing (an honest mistake), or both. I never received payment from KKM nor promise of payment from KKM. I was not employed by KKM while I was an employee of SVG.    On July 10, 2015 the two main principles at SVG questioned me about my biography on KKM's website. I explained that my relationship with KKM's CEO and KKM strictly related to the operation and support of the Armor Funds. I made clear that any interpretation otherwise of my KKM biography was a misunderstanding that could be cleared up. I offered to edit my KKM biography immediately if SVG was uncomfortable with it.   After reaching an agreement SVG regarding my KKM biography, I was presented with an ultimatum: I could continue to work at SVG only if I signed, immediately and on the spot, a lengthy after-the-fact Employment Agreement. I had never signed an employment agreement with SVG previously. I felt the tone of the discussion was unduly aggressive and hostile and I judged that they were unwilling to negotiate in good faith. Therefore, I declined to sign the Employment Agreement, which was mutually understood to serve as my as my immediate resignation from SVG.  In summary, SVG's compliance policies made no mention of how I should conduct myself with KKM. My conduct with KKM was strictly with regard to running the Armor Funds, which should reasonably be considered to fall within an acceptable scope of business interaction. I came to an agreement with SVG over how to handle my biography on KKM's website. I resigned from SVG when I felt I was being bullied into signing an after-the-fact employment agreement without a chance to properly understand what I was signing.""
