  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS ACCEPTANCE, WAIVER & CONSENT ACTION WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT I HAD INADVERTENTLY NOT REPORTED TO THE BROKER-DEALER FIRM THAT HELD MY SECURITIES LICENSES AT THAT TIME CERTAIN ADVISORY CLIENT COMPLAINTS RECEIVED IN 2002.  WHILE I HAD PROMPTLY REPORTED THE COMPLAINTS TO THE COMPLIANCE PERSONNEL AT CORNERSTONE WEALTH MANAGEMENT, MY INVESTMENT ADVISORY FIRM, AND WE IN TURN FOLLOWED ALL THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS MANDATED BY THE SEC, I WAS UNAWARE AT THAT TIME THAT I ALSO NEEDED TO REPORT THEM TO THE BROKER-DEALER FIRM.  OTHER THAN HANGING MY LICENSE WITH THE BROKER-DEALER FIRM, I WAS NOT DOING ANY BUSINESS WITH THE BROKER-DEALER FIRM.  IN 2006, CORNERSTONE HIRED A COMPLIANCE CONSULTING FIRM TO CONDUCT A COMPLIANCE AUDIT.  DURING THE AUDIT, I WAS INFORMED OF THE FINRA REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE REPORTING TO BROKER-DEALERS, SO I PROMPTLY REPORTED THE COMPLAINTS TO BOTH THE BROKER-DEALER FIRM AND FINRA.  WHILE \""BEING UNAWARE OF THE REGULATIONS\"" IS NOT AN EXCUSE, THE EXAMINER HANDLING THIS ACTION SAID THAT HE TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE VARIOUS MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING: (1) THE FACT THAT I HAD VOLUNTARILY REPORTED THIS ISSUE PROMPTLY UPON LEARNING OF THE FINRA REQUIREMENTS; (2) THAT THERE WAS NO INTENT TO HARM ANY CLIENTS OR HIDE INFORMATION; AND (3) THAT I HAD FOLLOWED ALL SEC REQUIREMENTS. THE SANCTIONS ISSUED BY THE EXAMINER WERE A REDUCED SUSPENSION TIME OF ONLY 10 DAYS (NORMAL SUSPENSION IS 30 DAYS) AND A WAIVED MONETARY FINE AS LONG AS I DO NOT RE-ACTIVATE MY SERIES 7 LICENSE WITH A BROKER-DEALER. I HAVE NOT BEEN AFFILIATED WITH A BROKER-DEALER SINCE 2007 AND MY SERIES 7 LICENSE HAS SINCE EXPIRED. I'VE BEEN WITH CORNERSTONE WEALTH MANAGEMENT SINCE 1999 PROVIDING INVESTMENT ADVICE TO CLIENTS. I TAKE MY FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES TO MY CLIENTS VERY SERIOUSLY AND CONSIDER THEIR BEST INTERESTS AT ALL TIMES.""
