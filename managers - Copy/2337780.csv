  ""Firm Name"" : ""PRUCO SECURITIES, LLC"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Registered Representative submitted a Company replacement form containing a non-genuine signature and non-genuine initials of a client to the Company in connection with an annuity application."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I do not know why this investigation occurred. In March 2017 I  became aware that firm was investigating me because some of my clients notified me that firm was questioning transfer/new account paperwork that they had signed.  They assured investigator that they were aware of all documentation and that they had signed accordingly.  I contacted my OSJ Compliance Officer but was not provided any information throughout this process.  At end of June, I was informed that I was being terminated.  The transaction in question was completed Nov. 2016.  The firm contacted me in April 2017 and informed me that they had called the client in question many times and mailed documents to her for review. The client in question personally executed all required documents and I was in compliance with all company procedures, so I am perplexed and dispute their finding.""
