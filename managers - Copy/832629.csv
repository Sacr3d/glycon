  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Admin Release 34-47266; IA Release 40-2104; January 28, 2003: The SEC instituted this proceeding pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, on November 8, 2002, with an Order Instituting Proceedings (OIP). On January 24, 2003, the Division of Enforcement filed a Motion that Respondent Dennis S. Herula be found in Default and that an Order making findings and imposing remedial sanctions be entered against him, for Respondent's failure to file an answer to the OIP in accordance with Rule 220(f) of the Commission's Rules of Practice. The Motion, filed pursuant to Rule 155(a) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, seeks an order barring Respondent from association with any broker or dealer and from any investment adviser. Respondent is in default under Rules 155(a) and 220(f) of the Commission's Rules of Practice because he failed to answer the OIP, or to respond to the honorable judge's December 13, 2002, Order to Show Cause. Accordingly, the judge finds the allegations in the OIP to be true: On April 1, 2002, the Commission filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against Herula and others, based on alleged violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws in Civil Action Number 02-154. On October 10, 2002, the court orally granted the Commission's motion for entry of final judgment by default against Herula. On October 17, 2002, the court issued a memorandum and order against Respondent, permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Respondent was ordered to pay disgorgement, along with prejudgment interest, in the total amount of $18,941,665.63, and was assessed a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $250,000."",
