  ""Broker Comment"" : ""A client emailed me updated financial information (monthly income/expenses and cash on hand) for an upcoming meeting that we had scheduled.  Based on the information he provided, I made the relevant updates and sent him a copy of the financial plan for us to review at the upcoming meeting.  When sending and updated report to a client, a stamp/notation was made in the CRM system indicating the guidance interaction.  Fidelity claimed I mis-documented the interaction since I did not have a verbal conversation with the client.  I was given the option to resign with a separation package which I did.""
