THERE WERE NEVER ANY UNAUTHORIZED TRADES DONE AND I SPOKE W/ HIM FREQUENTLY NOT ONLY  ABOUT THE POSITIONS THE HE OWNED BUT ALOS STOCKS THAT I THOUGHT W ESHOULD BE FOLLOWING AS POTENTIAL BUYS ALSO ABOUT THE OVERALL MARKET.   HE WAS FULLY ENGAGED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS ACCOUNT AND ALSO HAD PPOINTED QUESTIONS WHEN ANYTHING WAS NOT CLEAR.   WITH THE MARKET UPHEAVAL IN 2008 THE ACCOUNT LOST VALUE. BASED ON THE POSITIONS THAT WE HAD, I FELT  AND STILL BELIEVE THAT WITH TIME  AND PATIENCE WE COULD HAVE RECUPERATED THE LOSSES.   [CUSTOMER]'S ONLY COMPLAINT WAS ABOUT THE COMMISSIONS, MOST OF WHICH WERE GENERATED BEFORE THE MARKET TOOK A SIGNIFICANT TURN FOR THE WORST""
