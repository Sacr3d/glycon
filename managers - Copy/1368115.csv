I ADAMANTLY DENY THAT I ENGAGED IN ANY IMPROPER ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION WITH CLAIMANTS' STEPHENS ACCOUNTS.  THE EVIDENCE AT THE HEARING CLEARLY ESTABLISHED THAT, FOR THE MOST PART, CLAIMANTS DID NOT LOSE ANY MONEY AT STEPHENS INC.  IT IS ALSO CLEAR FROM THE RECORD THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS WERE WELL AWARE OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR ACCOUNTS AND THAT THE LIMITED TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THEY ENGAGED WERE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.  THE AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES IS EXCESSIVE IN LIGHT OF THE SIZE OF THE OVERALL AWARD RELATIVE TO THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES CLAIMED, AND THAT NEITHER I NOR STEPHENS ENGAGED IN ANY IMPROPER ACTIVITY.""
