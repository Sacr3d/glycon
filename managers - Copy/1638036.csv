  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS COMPLAINT AROSE OUT OF THE UNPRECEDENTED ILLIQUIDITY IN THE AUCTION RATE SECURITIES MARKET, A SITUATION THE FA DID NOT CAUSE AND OVER WHICH THE FA HAD NO CONTROL. **THIS MATTER INVOLVES THE SALE OF AUCTION RATE SECURITIES (ARS). THE CLIENT PURCHASED THE ARS BEFORE MID-FEBRUARY 2008, THAT IS PRIOR TO THE TIME WHEN THE ARS MARKET SUFFERED WIDESPREAD AUCTION FAILURES AND ILLIQUIDITY. THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR DID NOT CAUSE, CONTRIBUTE OR HAVE ANY CONTROL WHATSOEVER OVER THESE MARKET EVENTS. ON AUGUST 15, 2008, THE FIRM REACHED AGREEMENT WITH CERTAIN OF ITS REGULATORS, PURSUANT TO WHICH IT AGREED TO REIMBURSE CLIENTS FOR ANY LOSSES THEY INCURRED IF AND WHEN THEY SOLD SECURITIES ON A SECONDARY MARKET. PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, THE FIRM PAID THE CLIENT $22,000, REPRESENTING THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE CLIENT PAID FOR THE ARS AND THE PRICE SHE RECEIVED ON THE SECONDARY MARKET. THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR WAS NOT A PARTY TO THE AGREEMENT WITH THE REGULATORS, DID NOT MAKE ANY PAYMENTS TO THE CLIENT, AND WAS NOT ASKED TO AND DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE REPURCHASE AMOUNT. **FA'S RESPONSE:  FA STRENUOUSLY DENIES DESCRIBING ARPS AS RISK FREE AND CASH OR MONEY MARKET EQUIVALENTS. ALTHOUGH I AM SIGNING THIS DISCLOSURE, I BELIEVE THIS SETTLEMENT IS BETWEEN THE CLIENT AND THE FIRM.  FURTHERMORE, I SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO AMEND MY RECORDS.""
