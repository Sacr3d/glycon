  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC ADMIN RELEASES 33-9462, 34-70595, IA RELEASE 3686, INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 RELEASE 30740, OCTOBER 2, 2013: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\""COMMISSION\"") DEEMED IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 8A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (\""SECURITIES ACT\""), SECTION 15(B) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (\""EXCHANGE ACT\""), SECTIONS 203(E), 203(F), AND 203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 (\""ADVISERS ACT\""), AND SECTIONS 9(B) AND 9(F) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 (\""INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT\"") AGAINST ROLAND R. MANARIN (\""MANARIN\"") AND HIS TWO COMPANIES (COLLECTIVELY, \""RESPONDENTS\"").  THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT THE PROCEEDINGS AROSE FROM THE RESPONDENTS' MISCONDUCT IN THEIR MANAGEMENT OF THREE POOLED INVESTMENT VEHICLES (\""THE FUNDS\""). FIRST, FROM AT LEAST JUNE 2000 THROUGH MID-2010, MANARIN AND HIS INVESTMENT ADVISER FIRM BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES AS INVESTMENT ADVISERS BY CAUSING THE FUNDS TO BUY THE CLASS A SHARES OF UNDERLYING MUTUAL FUNDS (\""INVESTMENT FUNDS\"") EVEN WHEN THE FUNDS WERE ELIGIBLE TO OWN LOWER-COST \""INSTITUTIONAL\"" SHARES OF THE VERY SAME INVESTMENT FUNDS. AS A RESULT, THE FUNDS PAID AVOIDABLE, AND ONGOING, 12B-1 FEES ON THEIR INVESTMENT FUND HOLDINGS, WHICH WERE PASSED THROUGH TO THE INVESTMENT ADVISER'S AFFILIATED BROKER-DEALER. THIS PRACTICE WAS INCONSISTENT NOT ONLY WITH THE INVESTMENT ADVISER'S AND MANARIN'S DUTY TO SEEK BEST EXECUTION FOR THE FUNDS, BUT ALSO WITH MULTIPLE DISCLOSURES BY THE RESPONDENTS. SECOND, BETWEEN AT LEAST OCTOBER 2008 AND DECEMBER 2011, THE BROKER-DEALER CHARGED ITS AFFILIATED MUTUAL FUND COMMISSIONS THAT EXCEEDED THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY BROKER'S COMMISSION ON TRANSACTIONS EFFECTED ON A SECURITIES EXCHANGE. AS A RESULT OF THE CONDUCT, RESPONDENTS VIOLATED THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS.  BY FAILING TO SEEK BEST EXECUTION FOR THE FUNDS WHEN SELECTING AMONG AVAILABLE INVESTMENT FUND SHARE CLASSES, MANARIN WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 206(2) OF THE ADVISERS ACT; BY MAKING MATERIALLY MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE INVESTMENT ADVISER'S PRACTICE OF SEEKING BEST EXECUTION IN FUNDS' OFFERING DOCUMENTS, WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 206(4) OF THE ADVISERS ACT AND RULE 206(4)-8(A)(1) THEREUNDER; MANARIN ALSO WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 206(4) AND RULE 206(4)-8(A)(1) BY MAKING MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE INVESTMENT ADVISER'S BEST EXECUTION PRACTICES IN A FUND'S REGISTRATION STATEMENT, WHICH HE SIGNED AS PRESIDENT OF THE FUND; BY MAKING MATERIALLY MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE INVESTMENT ADVISER'S BEST EXECUTION PRACTICES IN A FUND'S REGISTRATION STATEMENT, MANARIN, AS PRESIDENT OF THE FUND, WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 34(B) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; AND BY OFFERING AND SELLING INTERESTS IN THE FUNDS THROUGH THE USE OF MATERIALLY MISLEADING OFFERING DOCUMENTS, RESPONDENTS WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 17(A)(2) OF THE SECURITIES ACT."",
