  ""Firm Name"" : ""THE CAMBRIDGE GROUP"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""VIOLATING FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES, APPLYING FOR AND TAKING THE SERIES 24 EXAM WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION, VIOLATING CONTRACT, SELLING AWAY, STEALING COMPANY PROPERTY."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I GAVE THE CAMBRIDGE GROUP A LETTER OF RESIGNATION ON THE EVENING OF 5/22/87.  PRIOR TO THIS THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OF ANY OF THESE ALLEGATIONS.  THAT EVENING, THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OTHER THAN MY FUTURE PLANS.  THE U-5 WAS NOT FILED UNTIL 8/3/87 AND I WAS NEVER GIVEN A COPY.  I DID NOT BECOME AWARE OF THE ALLEGATIONS UNTIL 1999, WHEN THE LEGACY WAS PUT ON THE WEB.  I BELIEVE THAT THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE FILED IN REVENGE FOR MY LEAVING.  NO ACTION WAS TAKEN BY THE NASD BECAUSE THESE ALLEGATIONS AND THE CAMBRIDGE GROUP, DID NOTHING FURTHER IN REGARDS TO THESE ALLEGATIONS.   THE CAMBRIDGE GROUP AND DONALD HATELY, OWNER, WERE SUBSEQUENTLY SANCTIONED AND FINED BY THE NASD FOR OTHER UNRELATED ACTIVITIES AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE, SHORTLY THEREAFTER LEFT THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY.  THERE WERE NO VIOLATIONS OF FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES.  ALL ACTIVITIES WERE DONE UNDER THE DIRECTION AND SUPERVISION OF MR. HATELY.  I APPLIED FOR AND TOOK THE SERIES 24 UNDER THE DIRECTION OF MR. HATELY SO THAT THERE WOULD BE A SECOND PRINCIPAL IN THE OFFICE AND AVAILABLE WHEN HE WAS OUT OF TOWN.  THERE WAS NO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH A NON-COMPETE CLAUSE.  AT THE TIME OF MY RESIGNATION, I MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO PICK UP MY PERSONAL BELONGINGS THE FOLLOWING DAY.  WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE DESIGNATED TIME, THE LOCKS ON THE DOORS HAD BEEN CHANGED AND MY PERSONAL ITEMS WERE WAITING FOR ME IN A BOX.  THERE WAS NO SELLING AWAY AND NEITHER THE CAMBRIDGE GROUP NOR THE NASD TOOK ANY FURTHER ACTION.""
