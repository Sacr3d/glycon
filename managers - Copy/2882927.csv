  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I recommended that the client sell a small portion of the over concentrated stock position to diversify the portfolio.  The recommendation was based on the value of 40 times earnings, which, historically, the stock price had only been that high twice in the last ten years.  The client agreed with my recommendation and then had misgivings when the price of the stock rose after he sold.""
