  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MERRILL LYNCH PAID $11,615.89 TO REIMBURSE SURRENDER CHARGES PER THEIR U-5 AMENDMENT. MERRILL LYNCH HAS NOT PROVIDED A COPY OF THE COMPLAINT, THE SETTLEMENT ON THE COMMISSION RECEIVED ON THE FIXED ANNUITY REPLACING THE VARIABLE ANNUITY. THE DAUGHTER, A CO-NNUITANT, WAS THE SUITIBILITY BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT. MERRILL LYNCH NEVER CONTACT ME REGARDING THIS.  THE DOLLAR OF REIMBURSEMENT IS A GROSS FIGURE AND DOES NOT REFLECT THE COMMISSION RECEIVED.  WE BELIEVE THE NET TO MERRILL LYNCH IS LESS THAN THE REQUIRED REPORTABLE AMOUNTS OF 22H(2).""
