IN MY OPINION THE PROBLEM RESULTED FROM ME FIRING HER AS MY REALTOR AND LISTING WITH ANOTHER REAL ESTATE AGENT.  I BELIEVE THAT THE LETTER WAS MORE PERSONAL IN NATURE THAN BUSINESS, SINCE SHE HAS TOLD ME ON MANY OCCASIONS THAT I DID NOT GIVE HER A FAIR CHANCE TO SELL MY HOME.  I STILL SPEAK WITH HER HUSBAND REGULARLY AND HE BEARS NO OUTWARD ANIMOSITY TOWARDS ME.""
