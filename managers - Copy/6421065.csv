  ""Broker Comment"" : ""AS EMBARRASSING AS THIS WHOLE SITUATION WAS I AM GLAD IT HAPPENED. I WAS YOUNG, DUMB, ADDICTED AND HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. THIS EVENT HELPED CHANGE MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER. I WAS ALSO EXPELLED FROM COLLEGE ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS. I USED THIS SECOND CHANCE AS MY WAY TO CHANGE MY WORLD AND MOVE FORWARD. THIS EVENT ALLOWED ME TO REGROUP AND NOT ONLY DID I BOUNCE BACK BUT I AM WAY STRONGER TODAY. I DID END UP WORKING MY WAY BACK INTO THE VERY COLLEGE THAT I WAS EXPELLED FROM AND I CURRENTLY HOLD A BACHELORS FROM THAT UNIVERSITY. NOW, HOPEFULLY, THIS MISTAKE CAN BE NOTED AS REQUIRED, BUT STILL ALLOW ME TO MOVE FORWARD WITH MY GOAL OF WORKING IN THE FINANCIAL REALM. THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.""
