  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN THE INTEREST OF FULL DISCLOSURE, THERE WAS A TERMINATION INCIDENT IN THE SUMMER OF 1998. I TRIED CALLING TO VERIFY THE EXACT DATE, BUT THE THE COMPANY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS MANY YEARS AGO.   I WAS 16 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME, WORKING AS A COURTESY CLERK AT COUNTY MARKET IN BILLINGS, MT. APPARENTLY THERE WAS A CASE OF BEER PLACED ON THE BACK LOADING DOCKS IN THE STORE AND BECAUSE I WAS THE NEW EMPLOYEE, I WAS SUSPECTED OF THEFT. I WAS ALSO INFORMED BY ANOTHER COWORKER THAT THERE WAS A MISSING PREGNANCY TESTER, WHICH ALSO INCREASED THE SUSPICION. MY EMPLOYMENT WAS TERMINATED FOR ALLEGED THEFT. I INSISTED THAT I'D DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG AND THE MANAGER EXPLAINED THAT NO PROOF WAS NEEDED AS I WAS IN MY 90 DAY PROBATION PERIOD WITH THE STORE. THIS IS THE ONLY TIME IN MY LIFE THAT I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF WRONGDOING OR TERMINATED AS SUCH.   AMANDA HEUCK""
