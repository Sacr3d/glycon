  ""SanctionDetails"" : [ ],
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Mr. Harris denies these allegations to the extent any are directed toward him individually.  Mr. Harris was a financial adviser with Stanford until 2009, when the company was dissolved and placed into receivership following the SEC action against the firm that alleged that CDs offered by Stanford were fraudulent.  As part of the dissolution process, the court-appointed receiver filed a clawback action that included more than 200 Stanford advisers as relief defendants, but made clear that Mr. Harris did not commit any wrongdoing and was added solely to facilitate relief.  Mr. Harris was misled by Stanford and at all times believed the CDs to be a legitimate investment for his clients.""
