  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN OCTOBER OF 2013, I WAS ACCUSED OF CHURNING BY MY MANAGER. THE TRADE I MADE FOR THIS WOMAN WAS AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE MARKET STRATEGIST FOR JP MORGAN ON A NATIONWIDE CALL TO CHASE INVESTMENT REPS.     I HAVE THIS CUSTOMER'S FULL SUPPORT. SHE STATES I DID NOT CHURN HER ACCOUNT. I ASKED FOR THE MANAGER'S PROOF; HE FAILED TO PRODUCE ANY EVIDENCE THAT I COULD NOT PROVE FALSE.  I RESIGNED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. THE FIRST BEING MY WIFE'S HEALTH IN 2013. I WAS UNABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HER AND DO MY JOB AS I WANTED. THE FALSE CHURNING ACCUSATION WAS MORE THAN I WAS WILLING TO PUT UP WITH. I  ASKED THE MANAGER WHETHER I WAS BEING FIRED, TERMINATED OR OTHERWISE LET GO. HE TOLD ME I SHOULD CONSIDER USING THE FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT. NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS MY 401K TO FEED MY FAMILY WAS UNWORKABLE FOR MY FAMILY.   I DECIDED TO RESIGN VOLUNTARILY. I WAS NOT TERMINATED.""

  ""Allegations"" : ""WHEN CUSTOMER CAME TO MY OFFICE HE INDICATED THAT HE WANTED TO HAVE SOME OF HIS MONEY PUT INTO A MODERATE INVESMTNET THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO WITHDRAW THE MONEY WITHOUT PENALTIES IF IT WAS NECESSARY. I ESTAABLISHED A HIGH YIELD BOND ACCOUNT FOR HIM. INTO THIS ACCOUNT HE PUT 3/4 OF THE MONEY HE WANTED TO WORK WITH THROUGH ME AND MY OFFICE.  THE OTHER ACCOUNT WAS DESIGNED, PER HIS REQUEST, TO BE A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT THAT WOULD GROW AT A STEADY RATE OF RETURN BUT THAT WOULD LEAVE ALONE FOR GROWTH. THE TIME FRAME FOR THIS INVESTMENT WAS INDICATED ON THE ACCOUNT APPLICATION AS A 6-10 YEAR TIME HORIZON. I ESTABLISHED A WELLS REIT ACCOUNT FOR HIM TO PUT THE 1/4 OF THE MONEY INTO. THESE TWO ACCOUNTS AND THEIR OBJECTIVES WERE PUT ON THE ACCPUNT APPLICATION. THE REIT WAS NOT SOLD AS A \""ONE YEAR INVESTMENT\"" IT WAS MARKED ASA  INTTERMIDIATE - TERM (6-10 YEAR) INVESTMENT ON THE APPLICATION. A PROSPECTUS WAS DELIVERED TO CUSTOMER AT THE TIME OF SALE THAT INDICATED WELLS EMERGENCY LIQUIDATION PROCEDURES. THE PROSPECTUS STATES THAT A CUSTOMER MAY SUBMIT A REQUEST TO LIQUIDATE FUNDS AFTER ONE YEAR FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES ONLY AND WILL ACCOMIDATE THOSE UP TP 3% OF FUND ASSETS. CUSTOMER HAD AN EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT OF OVER ONE YEAR AND HIS EMERGENCY REQUIRED HIM TO LIQUIDATE THIS INVESTMENT. WELLS WAS UNABLE TO LIQUIDATE THE INVESTMENT DURING 2004. A BUYER WAS FOUND FOR CUSTOMER'S SHARES AND A THIRD PARTY INTERMEDIARY (AMERICAN PARTNERSHIP BOARD) APPROVED BY XCU CAPITAL CORP (MY BD) HANDLED THE TRANSACTION. THE TRANSACTION WAS COMPLETED WITH A $340 FEE CHARGED TO THE SELLER, CUSTOMER. CUSTOMER NETTED $7,560 OF HIS ORIGINAL $8,000 INVESTMENT. THESE PROCESDS WERE SENT ON 7/30/04 TO CUSTOMER."",
