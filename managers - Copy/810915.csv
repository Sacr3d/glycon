  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CLAIM FOR PLAINTIFFS ALLEGED SHARE OF INCOME FROM INSURANCE SALE I MADE & FOR PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY FEES, TOTAL $5566.94. CIVIL ACTION & TRIAL JUDGEMENT AWARDED TO PLAINTIFF IN THE AMOUNT OF $5566.94.  AS OF 5/98 THE BALANCE DUE PLAINTIFF HAS BEEN REDUCED TO A CURRENT BALANCE OF $2,000 & IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE BALANCE WILL BE SATISFIED BY DECEMBER 1998. THIS WAS A DISPUTE WITH ANOTHER AGENT OVER HIS SHARE OF AN INSURANCE SALE I MADE AFTER PLAINTIFF LEFT OUR INSURANCE AGENCY & OBTAINED FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT IN ANOTHER FIELD.  I OFFERED 25% OF THE CASE INCOME, BUT HE FELT HE WAS ENTITLED TO THE SAME 50% SHARE HE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED HAD HE CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT WITH THE PRIOR AGENCY. I DISAGREED WITH THE COURTS DECISION BUT DID NOT APPEAL BECAUSE ATTORNEY FEES WERE RAPIDLY APPROACHING THE AMOUNT OF THE DISPUTED INCOME.""
