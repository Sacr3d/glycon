IN 2000 AND 2001, \""THE COMPANY\"" HAD CUSTODY OF CLIENT FUNDS AND SECURITIES BUT DID NOT PERFORM ITS ANNUAL SURPRISE CUSTODY VERIFICATIONS AS REQUIRED BY THE CUSTODY RULE. FROM JANUARY 2002 FORWARD, RESPONDENT WAS THE SENIOR OFFICER AT THE COMPANY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE COMPLETION OF THE CUSTODY VERIFICATIONS. HE KNEW AT THE TIME THE COMPANY ADVISED THE COMMISSION STAFF OF ITS PROPOSED COMPLIANCE PLAN THAT THE CUSTODY VERIFICATIONS COULD NOT BE COMPLETED AS REPRESENTED. RESPONDENT ENGAGED AN AUDITOR IN FEBRUARY 2002 TO PERFORM ONLY THE 2001 VERIFICATION FOR THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY DID NOT COMPLETE THE 2001 CUSTODY VERIFICATIONS UNTIL JULY 2003. RESPONDENT DID NOT ENGAGE AN AUDITOR TO BEGIN THE 2002 AND 2003 CUSTODY VERIFICATIONS FOR THE COMPANY UNTIL APRIL 2004. THE COMPANY COMPLETED THESE VERIFICATIONS IN MAY 2005. RESPONDENT DID NOT ENGAGE AN INDEPENDENT AUDITOR TO PERFORM THE CUSTODY VERIFICATION FOR 2004 FOR THE COMPANY UNTIL JANUARY 2005 AND COMPLETED THE VERIFICATION IN JUNE 2005. IN THIS VERIFICATION, AND IN EACH PRECEDING VERIFICATION, THE COMPANY'S AUDITORS DISCOVERED NO DISCREPANCIES IN THE COMPANY'S RECORDS OF ITS INVESTOR'S ASSETS. THE COMPANY FAILED TO TIMELY COMPLETE THE CUSTODY VERIFICATIONS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND RESPONDENT KNOWINGLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY ASSISTED THAT FAILURE. RESPONDENT AND THE COMPANY FAILED TO TIMELY ENGAGE AN AUDITING FIRM FOR THE 2002, 2003, AND 2004 VERIFICATIONS, OR TO PROVIDE A SPECIFIC DEADLINE TO THE AUDITORS."",
