  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The description of the client's allegations that appears above is inaccurate. The client did not allege that I \""misrepresented the tax-deferred status of a proposed 401K plan,\"" and, in fact, I did not do so. Instead, the client's complaints center on MassMutual's actual design and implementation of a 401(k) plan-steps in which I was not involved-as well as MassMutual's annual reviews of the plan-which occurred after had I joined a new firm in early 1997.   My role at MassMutual in 1996 was fairly limited. It involved introducing prospective clients to MassMutual's 401(k) plan compliance and service specialists, who thereafter designed 401(k) plans and conducted annual reviews.   With respect to this client, I did have initial communications in which I explained MassMutual's ability to help clients with 401(k) plans and the possibility of a 401(k) plan for salaried employees--one that would have to meet specific IRS criteria to be deemed qualified. I also attended a meeting in which I introduced the client to MassMutual's 401(k) plan compliance and service specialists. These initial communications did not include detailed review of the client and its employee base to determine the propriety of a particular 401K plan. After these introductory communications, I was no longer involved in the process. It was MassMutual's 401(k) plan compliance and service specialists who worked with the client to develop the 401(k) plan based on information provided by the client. I was never in a position to represent the tax-deferred status 401K plan that was implemented.  I left MassMutual in April 1997 for a position with a new firm. In 2005, eight years after my departure, the client raised its concerns with MassMutual. Neither party contacted me for information-I was not involved in the 401(k) plan design, implementation or annual compliance discussions that were the subject of the client's complaint. I had no involvement in the parties' discussions that led to the settlement.""
