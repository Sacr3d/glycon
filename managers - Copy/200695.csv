  ""Allegations"" : ""IA Release 40-5062 / November 6, 2018:   The Securities and Exchange Commission (\""Commission\"") deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\""Advisers Act\"") against Mark A. Elste (\""Respondent\"").   The Commission finds that from January 2012 to June 2014, Mark A. Elste (\""Elste\""), who was the Chief Executive Officer (\""CEO\"") and Chief Investment Officer (\""CIO\"") of Pennant Management, Inc. (\""Pennant\""), a formerly registered investment adviser, aided, abetted and caused Pennant's violations of Section 206(4) of the Adviser Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder (the \""Compliance Rule\""). During this time, Elste was aware that Pennant's compliance program lacked sufficient resources but failed timely to address this deficiency, which contributed substantially to Pennant's Compliance Rule violations. Among other things, Pennant failed to implement its policies and procedures regarding periodic monitoring of employee e-mails, allocation of investment opportunities in its Small Business Administration (\""SBA\"") and U.S. Department of Agriculture (\""USDA\"") repurchase agreement (\""Repo\"") program, and maintenance of Repo trade allocation records. Additionally, Elste learned of general issues related to Pennant's informal process for initial and ongoing due diligence and monitoring of Repo counterparties, but did not cause Pennant to amend its policies and procedures accordingly."",
