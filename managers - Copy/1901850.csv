  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The firm conducted a thorough review and found no basis for the allegations.  Accordingly, the firm denied the claim without further action and without payment of any damages by myself or the firm. I have been in the business for over 26 years and I have done an estimated 40000 transactions and or financial plans for clients. I am in good standing  with  my employer Bremer Investment Services, Raymond James and the securities regulatory agencies that oversees our industry. I am flattered to be a part of these organizations because they exist to protect investors. I have never been fined, suspended or caused any client to lose money due to improper dealings for any reason of any kind or I would be barred from the industry. That is what makes these allegations unjustified. For me any behavior that Is NOT correct goes against my moral compass, upbringing, integrity and the trust that literally thousands of  great people have graciously given me. I am proud of how I have conducted my business and I look forward to many years of continued stewardship of client's trust, dreams, and goals that has been the true trademark and my record in the securities business. I am  passionate about my reputation and I can and will give anyone references of clients or colleagues to contact to confirm my integrity.""
