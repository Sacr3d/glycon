  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CLIENT'S LETTER IS INACCURATE ON A NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS.  WE WENT OVER THE 5% AT THE TIME OF THE PURCHASE, AS INDICATED BY HIS INITIALS ON THE APPLICATION PAPERWORK. AS REQUIRED, I MAKE SURE TO REVIEW THIS INFORMATION IN DETAIL VERBALLY WITH EVERY CLIENT AT THE TIME OF SIGNING PAPERWORK.       REGARDING NOT BEING ABLE TO GET A HOLD OF ME, I HAVE DOCUMENTED CONTACT OR ATTEMPTED CONTACT WITH THE CLIENT AND/OR HIS WIFE (WHO IS ALSO A CLIENT) ON ELEVEN OCCASIONS INCLUDING 4 EMAILS TO WHICH THEY REPLIED AND TWO MEETINGS IN PERSON AT THEIR HOME.   I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM HIS WIFE ON THE 11TH REQUESTING A COPY OF THE POLICY BE MAILED OUT BUT WITH NO URGENCY OR CONCERN COMMUNICATED AND NO IMMEDIATE REPLY REQUESTED SO I ASSUMED SHE WANTED ME TO BRING IT TO OUR UPCOMING APPOINTMENT.  I THEN RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM THE CLIENT ON 17TH AT 11:23AM WHICH I RETURNED AT 4:18PM.  AGAIN THERE WAS NEITHER URGENCY COMMUNICATED NOR ANY FRUSTRATION WITH THE ACCOUNT.  AFTER CLARIFYING WHAT HE WANTED, I LET HIM KNOW I WOULD WORK ON GETTING THAT INFO OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IT APPEARS THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN SIMULTANEOUSLY TO THIS SECOND CONVERSATION.     REGARDING RECEIVING A CONTRACT, IT WAS VERIFIED THAT ONE WAS MAILED TO HIS ADDRESS OF RECORD IN A TIMELY FASHION AFTER THE INITIAL CONTRACT SIGNING.   REGARDING THE PROSPECTUS, I THINK I MUST HAVE GIVEN HIM ONE BUT I DO NOT HAVE ANY DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT.  ADDITIONALLY HE HAS RECEIVED AT LEAST TWO BY MAIL.""
