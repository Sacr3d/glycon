  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Phlong consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that as his member firm's designated principal for review and approval of trading, despite a lack of prior supervisory experience, Phlong failed to establish, maintain and enforce supervisory systems and procedures reasonably designed to provide for the proper review and approval of daily orders. The findings stated that the firm's Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) gave him no instructions as to his duties, Phlong did not read the firm's written supervisory procedures (WSPs), and he was unaware of what his role or responsibilities as a principal were. Although he was required to do so by the firm's WSPs, Phlong failed to conduct any principal review or approval of the firm's order tickets or daily trade blotters from his designation as principal until the firm ceased trading."",
