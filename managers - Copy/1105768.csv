  ""Allegations"" : ""Client complained about performance of VA investment and further alleged that he was not properly informed of the potential for market fluctuation and fees associated with the same VA, purchased in 2012 through a former CFS representative with an investment of $150,000. The client sold the VA in 2018, which resulted in a loss of value at surrender. CFS review revealed that full disclosure of material information and fees associated with annuity were made at the time of purchase and that signed documentation supported suitability for the VA recommendation. Accordingly, CFS denied the client complaint in writing on 2/26/2018."",
