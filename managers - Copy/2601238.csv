  ""Allegations"" : ""WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, ELLERBROOK CONSENTED TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT SHE FALSELY REPRESENTED ON AN INTERNAL ELECTRONIC REQUEST FORM THAT SHE HAD VERBALLY \""VERIFIED REQUESTOR'S IDENTITY AND CONFIRMED INSTRUCTIONS\"" PRIOR TO INITIATING A $22,000 WIRE TRANSFER FROM A MEMBER FIRM CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT TO A THIRD PARTY. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT ELLERBROOK ATTEMPTED TO REACH THE CUSTOMER BY PHONE, TO VERBALLY CONFIRM THE INSTRUCTIONS, AS REQUIRED BY HER FIRM'S POLICIES. ELLERBROOK WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK TO THE CUSTOMER DIRECTLY, AND LEFT A VOICEMAIL MESSAGE. THE FIRM LEARNED THAT THE CUSTOMER'S EMAIL ACCOUNT HAD BEEN HACKED AND THAT THE EMAILS ELLERBROOK HAD RECEIVED FROM THE CUSTOMER'S EMAIL ADDRESS, AND SUBSEQUENTLY ACTED UPON, WERE FRAUDULENT. THE FIRM SUBSEQUENTLY CREDITED THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE WITHDRAWAL. AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER REQUESTED THE WIRE TRANSFER, THERE HAD BEEN A STANDING ORDER TO DISTRIBUTE $7,000 FROM THE ACCOUNT TO THE CUSTOMER, ON A MONTHLY BASIS. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO LONGER SUFFICIENT CASH TO DISTRIBUTE THOSE FUNDS FROM THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT, BECAUSE ALMOST THE ENTIRE CASH BALANCE HAD BEEN WIRED TO THE THIRD PARTY. ELLERBROOK ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT THE CUSTOMER BY TELEPHONE TO OBTAIN AUTHORITY TO SELL 1,000 SHARES OF A PREFERRED STOCK. WITHOUT THE CUSTOMER'S KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT, ELLERBROOK LIQUIDATED 1,000 SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK FROM THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO FUND THE STANDING MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION."",
