  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CUSTOMER APPLIED FOR A MORTGAGE, HOWEVER 2 WEEKS PRIOR HAD APPLIED FOR A HOME EQUITY LOAN, WHICH WAS DECLINED FOR VALUE, I ASKED THE CUSTOMER WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND ALL THEY WANTED WAS A LOWER RATE.  I SPOKE TO THEM ABOUT A 15 YR FIXED MORTGAGE, THEY WANTED TO GO FORWARD WITH IT.  I TOLD THEM I WOULD TRY TO GET OUR MOURTGAGE DEPT TO USE THE EXISTING APPRAISAL AND NOT TO DATE THE CREDIT CARD AUTHORIZATION FOR THE NEW APPRAISAL TILL I HEARD BACK FROM THE MORTGAGE DEPT, IT TOOK THEM 4 DAYS TO TELL ME THEY WOULD NOT USE THE EXISTING APPRAISAL.

THE EMPLOYEE WHO WAS HELPING WITH THIS FILE, THEN SENT THE DOCUMENT TO SECURITY IN WHICH THEY IN TURN TERMINATED ME FOR CHANGING THE DATE, EVEN WITH THE CUSTOMERS PERMISSION.""
