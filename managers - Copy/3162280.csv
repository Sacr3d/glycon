  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS TERMINATED FROM SOUNDVIEW AS A RESULT OF THE FIRM CUTTING BACK ON PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY WAS LOSING MONEY AND NEEDED TO CUT EXPENSES. THE CEO OF THE COMPANY DID NOT WANT TO HONOR MY CONTRACT PAYING ME A $500,000 BONUS FOR COMPLETION OF 6 INITIATIONS OF COVERAGE AND A SURVEY OF CIO'S IN THE INDUSTRY. I SAMPLED AN ADEQUATE NUMBER OF CIOS WHICH WAS FOUND TO BE DEFICIENT. I BELIEVE THAT SOUNDVIEW USED AN ARBITRARY SAMPLE NUMBER TO HAVE AN EXCUSE TO TERMINATE MY CONTRACT.""
