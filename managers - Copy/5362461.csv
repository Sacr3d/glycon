  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Following a thorough suitability review which addressed the client's financial situation and investment goals, the Representative recommended and the client approved the purchase of an Allianz Annuity.  Approximately one year after purchase, the client claimed that the Representative failed to disclose material features of the Annuity.  Additionally, the client claims that the Representative advised him that the Annuity was guaranteed. The Representative acted properly at all time by making required disclosures both verbally and in writing.  The client's claim has no merit and the Representative denies all allegations.""
