  ""Broker Comment"" : ""QUOTED FROM THE U-5, UPDATED BY ASSOCIATED SECURITIES, \""WHILE WE BELIEVE THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO MERIT TO THE CUSTOMERS' COMPLAINTS, OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION ONLY, WE ARE FILING THIS UPDATE.  THE CUSTOMERS NEVER SPECIFIED IN THEIR COMPLAINT, THE AMOUNT OF THEIR PORPORTED DAMAGES.  HOWEVER, DURING THE REVIEW OF THIS MATTER, IT WAS DETERMINED IN MARCH THAT THE CLIENTS HAD CAPITAL GAINS OF APPROXIMATELY $108,000.00, FROM THE LIQUIDATIONS OF THEIR INVESTMENTS; LIQUIDATIONS THAT THE CLIENTS AUTHORIZED.  ARGUABLY, BASED ON THIS FIGURE, THEY COULD HAVE HAD A TAX LIABILITY RANGING FROM $16,200, (IF THEY WERE IN THE 15% TAX BRACKET) TO $37,800 (THEY WERE IN THE 35% TAX BRACKET).  THERE WAS NO BASIS FOR THE CLIENTS' ALLEGATIONS HOWEVER, THAT THEY WERE NOT INFORMED BY THE REP OF THE POTENTIAL TAX LIABILITY.  THE CLIENTS PROVIDED COST BASIS INFORMATION TO THE ADVISOR IN ORDER FOR HIM DETERMINE THE CAPITAL GAINS PRIOR TO ANY LIQUIDATIONS.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE CUSTOMERS VACILIATED BACK & FORTH BETWEEN ASC AND THEIR PREVIOUS BROKER WHO THEY WERE DISSATISFIED WITH.  IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE ASC ADVISOR SOLD THEIR POSITTIONS THAT THEY CLAIMED THAT THEY WERE UNAWARE OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES.  THEY TRANSFERRED THEIR ACCOUNT BACK TO THEIR PRIOR BROKER DESPITE THEIR PREVIOUS DISSATISFACTION WITH HIM.  THEIR COMPLAINT WAS DENIED AS THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THEIR ALLEGATIONS.""
