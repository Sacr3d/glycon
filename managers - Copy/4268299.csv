  ""Firm Name"" : ""Invesco Distributors, Inc"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Voluntary Resignation"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Invesco claims I emailed proprietary data to my personal computer. I have retained an attorney and we are cooperating with Invesco to give sufficient evidence that the items in question were deleted  and no longer in my possession or PGIM's."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I did not download, use or convey any client financial information.  Upon notification of Invesco's concerns, I fully cooperated with Invesco. The investigation was concluded, and no action was taken.  Until notified by Invesco, I did not understand that I had downloaded information that Invesco deemed proprietary as these were files I had either used, created, and/or edited while employed at Invesco, and did not contain any retail customer financial information. At the time the issue was raised, I was still employed by Invesco, but had given notice of my voluntary resignation and was serving out the term of my notice period. Upon being made aware of Invesco's concerns, I made available for Invesco's inspection all of my personal electronic devices, and cooperated fully with Invesco's investigation. No proprietary information was shared with Prudential Financial or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.  This was an internal employment issue only, and not a customer-related issue.""
