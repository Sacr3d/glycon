  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN RESPONSE TO THE CRITICISMS EXPRESSED BY CLENT'S DAUGHTER IN HER LETTER OF JULY 18, 2008, I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT MY SIDE OF THE SITUATION.  ALTHOUGH IT IS NOW 2010 AND CLIENT'S DAUGHTER IS WRITING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN 2001, I AM QUITE CERTAIN THAT MY MEMORY IN THIS MATTER IS CLEAR.   I BELIEVE THAT I FIRST MET CLIENT AND HER DAUGHTER IN THE SPRING OF 2000.  CLIENT'S ACCOUNT WAS ONE THAT I INHERITED AFTER A PARTNERSHIP AT PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES LEFT THE FIRM.  FROM THE FIRST TIME THAT I CONTACTED CLIENT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF, SHE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT SHE WAS NOT WELL VERSED IN THE FINANCIAL ARENA, AND WOULD PREFER TO ALWAYS HAVE ME SPEAK WITH HER DAUGHTER ABOUT HER ACCOUNT AND ANY RELATED ITEMS.  I WAS HAPPY TO DO THIS.  I FELT AN AFFINITY FOR CLIENT, WHO WAS AN ELDERLY DUTCH WOMAN, AS MY MOTHER IS.   THROUGHOUT THE NEXT FEW YEARS, I MET OFTEN WITH CLIENT AND HER DAUGHTER, EITHER AT THEIR HOMES OR IN OUR SATELLITE OFFICE LOCATED IN VENICE, FL.  I NEVER HAD THE OCCASION TO SPEAK WITH CLIENT OUTSIDE OF HER DAUGHTER'S PRESENCE, UNLESS IT WAS TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE THREE OF US.  THE DAUGHTER'S ALLEGATIONS THAT ANY TYPE OF INVESTMENTS WERE PURCHASED IN THIS ACCOUNT WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE ARE UTTERLY AND COMPLETELY BASELESS.  FURTHER, EACH AND EVERY INVESTMENT RECOMMENDED BY MYSELF WAS WITHIN CLIENT'S RISK TOLERANCE AND IN LINE WITH HER INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE PURCHASED.  AGAIN I STRESS THAT NO PURCHASES OCCURRED WITHOUT THE EXPRESS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE DAUGHTER, AT THE CLIENT'S SIDE.  I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH CLIENT AND HER DAUGHTER ENDED WHEN I TOOK A POSITION AS BRANCH ADMINISTRATOR IN THE WINTER OF 2004.  ALL INVESTMENTS NEED TO BE MONITORED, AND I CANNOT ANSWER AS TO HOW WELL CLIENT'S INVESTMENTS WERE MONITORED BEYOND THE TIME THAT I WAS THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR ON THE ACCOUNT.   WHILE I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND DAUGHTER'S CONCERN AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED WITHIN HER MOTHER'S ACCOUNT, I AM CERTAIN THAT SHOULD SHE READ THIS LETTER, SHE WILL CONCUR WITH ALL OF THE EVENTS.""
