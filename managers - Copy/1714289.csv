  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Client sought $675,000, plus legal fees and other damages on accounts that had a positive total cumulative return while managed by Craig Hodges from 2013-2017.  Craig Hodges, Hodges Capital Management, and First Dallas Securities denied any liability because they believed (i) all investments selected had been suitable for the client's investment directives, (ii) the accounts were negatively impacted by the unexpected downturn in the energy sector, and (iii) the accounts had recovered in value and were well-positioned when the client made demand for compensation.  The award compensated the client for less than 10% of the total damages claimed, and provided no separate recovery to client for legal fees or expert expenses.""
