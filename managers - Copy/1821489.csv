  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 22478, SEPTEMBER 10, 2012: ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2012, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FILED AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN BOSTON CHARGING A MASSACHUSETTS-BASED CORPORATION AND OTHERS FOR THEIR ROLES IN A FRAUDULENT OFFERING OF UNREGISTERED CORPORATION SECURITIES. THE DEFENDANTS ARE CHARGED WITH DEFRAUDING INVESTORS THROUGH VARIOUS MISREPRESENTATIONS AND SCHEMES WHILE RAISING AT LEAST $26 MILLION IN INVESTOR FUNDS.  IN ADDITION TO THE CORPORATION, THE COMMISSION'S COMPLAINT CHARGES JONATHAN MORRONE, A FORMER SENIOR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CORPORATION, AMONG OTHER DEFENDANTS. THE COMMISSION ALSO NAMED ANOTHER COMPANY, AN ENTITY CONTROLLED BY ONE OF THE DEFENDANTS, AS A RELIEF DEFENDANT BASED ON ITS RECEIPT OF INVESTOR FUNDS. ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION'S COMPLAINT, THE CORPORATION, WHICH PURPORTS TO DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE AND SELL A MACHINE FOR COMBATING THE USE OF DANGEROUS BIOLOGICAL AGENTS THROUGH THE MAILS, AND ITS PRINCIPALS BEGAN ENGAGING IN UNREGISTERED OFFERS AND SALES OF SECURITIES TO INVESTORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND, AFTER ATTRACTING THE ATTENTION OF VARIOUS DOMESTIC STATE REGULATORS, BEGAN UTILIZING \""BOILER ROOM\"" FIRMS TO ASSIST IN SELLING SHARES OF CORPORATION SECURITIES TO OVERSEAS INVESTORS PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE COMMISSION'S COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT, WHILE MAKING UNREGISTERED OFFERS AND SALES OF SECURITIES TO US INVESTORS, MORRONE, AND OTHER DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE CLAIMS TO INVESTORS THAT THE CORPORATION WAS NOT PAYING FINANCIAL COMPENSATION TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND OFFICERS. THE COMPLAINT FURTHER ALLEGES THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS GAVE POTENTIAL INVESTORS THE FALSE IMPRESSION THAT THE CORPORATION PRESERVED ITS CASH ASSETS BY HAVING EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED FOR NO, OR VERY LITTLE, PAY, SUGGESTING THAT THESE EMPLOYEES WERE WORKING SOLELY OR PRIMARILY FOR \""SWEAT EQUITY\"" SHARES, WHICH MIGHT LATER BECOME VALUABLE WHEN THE COMPANY BECAME PROFITABLE OR UNDERWENT AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF STOCK. IN FACT, THE CORPORATION'S LARGEST EXPENSE DURING THOSE YEARS WAS THE MONEY IT PAID TO MORRONE, OTHER DEFENDANTS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES FROM FUNDS RAISED FROM INVESTORS; IN 2004 ALONE, THE CORPORATION PAID APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION IN COMPENSATION TO ITS OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. THE COMMISSION'S COMPLAINT FURTHER ALLEGES THAT, AS THE CORPORATION BEGAN RAISING MONEY OVERSEAS, THE DEFENDANTS TRANSFORMED THE COMPANY INTO A DECEPTIVE AND FRAUDULENT DEVICE DESIGNED TO ENRICH ITS PRINCIPALS WHILE ALSO PAYING AS MUCH AS 75% OF INVESTOR PROCEEDS AS COMMISSIONS TO ITS OVERSEAS BOILER ROOM FUNDRAISERS. THE CORPORATION'S MOST SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF CASH GENERATION AND MOST SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE WAS NOT MANUFACTURING AND SELLING MACHINES, BUT INSTEAD WAS ITS SECURITIES PROMOTION AND SALES ACTIVITIES. THE CORPORATION AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES DID NOT TELL INVESTORS THAT 75% OF FUNDS RECEIVED FROM THEM WOULD BE GOING STRAIGHT TO BOILER ROOM OPERATORS. THE COMMISSION ALLEGES THAT ALL DEFENDANTS VIOLATED SECTION 17(A) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (\""SECURITIES ACT\"") AND SECTION 10(B) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (\""EXCHANGE ACT\"") AND RULE 10B-5 THEREUNDER; THAT THE CORPORATION, MORRONE, AND OTHER DEFENDANTS VIOLATED SECTIONS 5(A) AND 5(C) OF THE SECURITIES ACT; AND THAT MORRONE, AND OTHER DEFENDANTS VIOLATED SECTION 15(A)(1) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT. THE COMMISSION ALSO ALLEGES, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, THAT MORRONE AND ANOTHER DEFENDANT ARE LIABLE UNDER SECTION 20(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AS CONTROL PERSONS OF THE CORPORATION FOR THE CORPORATION'S VIOLATIONS OF SECURITIES ACT SECTION 17(A) AND EXCHANGE ACT SECTION 10(B) AND RULE 10B-5 THEREUNDER. THE SEC SEEKS IN ITS ACTION PERMANENT INJUNCTIONS, DISGORGEMENT PLUS PREJUDGMENT INTEREST, CIVIL PENALTIES, AND, AGAINST MORRONE, AND OTHER DEFENDANTS, OFFICER AND DIRECTOR BARS."",
