  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT AN APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT WAS MADE.  THIS CLIENT HAD INDICATED THAT THEY WERE BUYING A HOUSE AFTER RETIREMENT IN AT LEAST A 3 YEAR TIME SPAN.  THEY WERE TOLD THAT THIS WAS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A SHORTER TIME SPAN.   I WAS ALSO INFORMED THAT THE HUSBAND WAS AN EXPERIENCED INVESTOR.  AFTER PLACING THIS INVESTMENT, THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET TOOK A SHARP DOWNWARD DIRECTION, AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS WHAT CREATED THE BUYERS' REMORSE.""
