  ""Broker Comment"" : "" (3) INITIATED BY: KNIGHTSTOWN INDIANA COURTHOUSE.  (4) TYPE OF EVENT OR PROCEEDING: CRIMINAL CONVERSION CHARGE.  (5) DATE INITIATED: MARCH 1982.  (6) DOCKET OR CASE NO: NONE I KNOW OF.  (7) ALLEGATIONS: CRIMINAL CONVERSION.  (8)(A) CURRENT STATUS: CHARGES DROPPED.     (B) DATE: APRIL 1982.     (C) RESULT: CHARGES DROPPED BEFORE GOING TO COURT.  (9) SUMMARY: I REPOSSESSED INVENTORY FROM A CLIENT WHO HAD               VIOLATED A SECURITY AGREEMENT. THE REPO WAS WITH               FULL KNOWLEDGE OF MY EMPLOYER, MIDWEST EQUIPMENT               CO., AND WITH THE HELP OF THE CLIENT. THE CLIENT'S              LAWYER HAD ME ARRESTED TWO WEEKS LATER. THE              CHARGES WERE SO LUDICROUS THAT THEY WERE DROPPED              BEFORE THEY COULD COME TO TRIAL. SCHMALTZ, WHILE EMPLOYED BY MIDWEST EQUIPMENT CO., REPOSSESSED MERCHANDISE ON BEHALF OF HIS EMPLOYER. HE STATES THAT THE REPOSSESSION WAS COMPLETELY VALID IN THAT THE DEALER HAD VIOLATED HIS SECURITY AGREEMENT. THE REPOSSESSION TOOK PLACE DURING REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS, WITH THE CONSENT OF THE DEALER, AND IN THE DEALER'S PRESENCE. SEVERAL WEEKS LATER, A LAWYER ADVISED THE DEALER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT SCHMALTZ FAILED TO GET WRITTEN CONSENT FROM THE DEALER AND DID NOT GIVE HIM A RECEIPT. THE DEALER ACCORDINGLY FILED CHARGES AND SCHMALTZ WAS ARRESTED. THE CHARGES WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT A HEARING.""
