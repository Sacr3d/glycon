  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN REFERENCE TO THE LIEN ON MY HOME, THIS IS DUE TO AN OUTSTANDING SEWAGE BILL AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO WHICH THIS OCCURRED. WHEN THE SEWAGE DEPARTMENT BROUGHT SEWAGE TO THE AREA, WE HAD A $6,100.00 TAP IN FEE. CONSIDERING THAT WHEN THE AMOUNT CAME DUE I WAS UNEMPLOYED DUE TO COMPANY DOWNSIZING, I WAS UNABLE TO GET A LOAN ON THAT AMOUNT WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT. I TRIED MANY AVENUES TO DO SO. I ALSO SPOKE TO THE ATTORNEY FOR THE SEWAGE DEPARTMENT AND GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS NO BIG DEAL AND IF I AGREED TO THE HIGHER INTEREST AMOUNT PAYING IT OFF MONTHLY THAT A LIEN WOULD NOT BE ATTACHED TO MY HOME. I'M NOT SURE IF THIS WAS MISINFORMATION OR MISUNDERSTANDING ON MY PART. I HAVE BEEN MAKING MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO GET THIS RECTIFIED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.""
