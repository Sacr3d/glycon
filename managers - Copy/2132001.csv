  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MY RESPONSE TO THE ALLEGATIONS RAYMOND JAMES PROVIDED ON MY U-4 THAT THEY WERE \""NO LONGER COMFORTABLE SUPERVISING - MISREPRESENTATION REGARDING MATERIAL FACTS REGARDING TERMINATION FROM PRIOR FIRM\"" AND LISTING \""SECURITIES VIOLATION\"" ON THE U-4. I WAS INTRODUCED TO RAYMOND JAMES (RJ) BY A RECRUITER ON 10/8/10 AND SPENT APPROX. 30 MINUTES ON THE PHONE WITH A RJ COMPLIANCE REP.  MOST OF THE CALL I SPENT PROVIDING DETAILED BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE AT HL AND SUBSEQUENT \""ALLOWED TO RESIGN.\""  RJ FELT COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT TOOK PLACE AND OFFERED ME THE ABILITY TO JOIN THE FIRM, WHICH I ACCEPTED.  I BEGAN TRANSITIONING CLIENTS TO RJ.  ON 10/20/10, THE RJ COMPLIANCE REPRESENTATIVE WITH WHICH I SPOKE, SET UP A CONFERENCE CALL TO DISCUSS SOME ISSUES AFTER A \""CREDIBLE\"" HILLIARD LYONS(HL) EMPLOYEE CALLED HER.  DURING THE CALL ON THE 20TH, THE RJ COMPLIANCE REPRESENTATIVE ASKED ME IF I HAD ACCESS TO THE CLIENT'S CHECKBOOK THAT SURROUNDED MY LEAVING HL.  I, WITHOUT HESITATION, REPLIED THAT THE CLIENT ASKED ME TO HOLD HIS CHECKBOOK SINCE HE VISITED ME 3-4 TIMES/WK AND WAS ALWAYS FORGETTING HIS CHECKBOOK.  THE RJ COMPLIANCE REP. THEN TOLD ME THAT I ANSWERED THAT QUESTION DIFFERENTLY WHEN WE SPOKE ON 10/8/10.  I REPLIED THAT \""I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER YOU ASKING ME THAT QUESTION\"" AND EMPHASIZED THAT WHEN SHE ASKED ME THAT SAME QUESTION A FEW MOMENTS AGO, I PROVIDED AN IMMEDIATE HONEST RESPONSE.  SHE EITHER DIDN'T ASK ME, I DIDN'T HEAR THE QUESTION OR I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION WHEN SHE ASKED IT ON 10/8/10.  THE RJ COMPLIANCE REP. WAS UNDETERRED WITH HER FEELING THAT I HAD MISREPRESENTED MYSELF AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO MY LEAVING HL.  THE FOLLOWING DAY (10/21/10) RJ DECIDED TO TERMINATE ME.  I REPLIED HONESTLY TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE PUT BEFORE ME ON 10/8/10 AND ALSO ON 10/20/10. I BELIEVE THE LANGUAGE RJ PROVIDED FOR MY U-4 IS FAR TOO HARSH AND BORDERS ON NEGLIGENT.  I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED (ONES IN WHICH I HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD) HONESTLY.  I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME UNDERSTANDING HOW I COULD HAVE CREATED A \""SECURITIES VIOLATION\"" WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE CLIENT AT RJ.  RJ HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE FAIR IN HOW THEY COMMUNICATE THEIR PERCEPTIONS TO FINRA TO UPDATE MY U-4.  A MORE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE FROM RJ MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO ASK ME TO RESIGN IF THEY NO LONGER FELT COMFORTABLE WITH ME.""
