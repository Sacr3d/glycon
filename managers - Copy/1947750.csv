  ""Broker Comment"" : ""These clients were clients for previous 8 years without complaint.  Moderate growth was strategy throughout that time frame.  Client's withdrawal rate during that time frame averaged approximate 10% annually.  The gradual decrease in value due to withdrawals accelerated with COVID-19 impact on markets and that was when complaint was made. We had discussed on many occasions that the withdrawal rate would cause a gradual decline in valuation.  There was conflict between the clients because she was withdrawing a larger amount each month than he wanted to withdraw.  The gains during the time we managed funds were in excess of 1.2 million dollars. Their withdrawals were in excess of 2.4 million dollars.""
