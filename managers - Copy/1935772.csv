  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON 4/8/2012, I ADDED ADDITONAL CONTENT TO MY BUSINESS CARD TEMPLATE, AND MISTAKENLY ENTERED MY PERSONAL EMAIL ADDRESS, PRINTED THE CARD. I KEPT CARD IN MY OFFICE DESK FOR SCHEDULED AUDIT TWO DAYS LATER, WITH INTENT TO HAND IT TO THE AUDITOR IN ORDER TO SUBMIT IT FOR APPROVAL. AT END OF AUDIT, I PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF STATIONERY BEING USED. I PROVIDED LETTERHEAD, FAX COVER AND THE BUSINESS CARD I HAD JUST PREPARED TWO DAYS PRIOR. I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT I NEEDED TO SUBMIT THE BUSINESS CARD FOR APPROVAL, AND STILL DID NOT NOTICE MY PERSONAL EMAIL ADDRESS ON THE CARD.  A FEW DAYS LATER, THE AUDITOR CALLED ME TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE CARD: WHY MY PERSONAL EMAIL ADDRESS AND THE PHRASE NEAR TOP OF CARD. I THEN REALIZED THAT I HAD MISTAKENLY TYPED MY PERSONAL INSTEAD OF BUSINESS EMAIL ADDRESS, AND THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN TO ASK THAT THE CARD BE APPROVED. THE AUDITOR ASKED ME TO FAX TO HIM A COPY OF THE BUSINESS CARD I HAD BEEN USING, WHICH I IMMEDIATELY DID.  A WEEK LATER, THE SAMED AUDITOR CALLED BACK TO INFORM ME THAT INVESTACORP DECIDED TO DISCHARGE ME FOR CAUSE, REASON BEING \""UNAUTHORIZED USE OF BUSINESS CARD THAT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED\"".""
