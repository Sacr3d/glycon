  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I met with the client on two separate occasions and spoke over the phone after the two meetings. The client was not satisfied with the VA performance which was allocated to the fixed account. She did not want to take market risk for potentially greater return. I recommended a fixed index annuity that provides no market risk but still has potential for greater returns than the fixed account for the VA. All features were discussed and acknowledged including surrender period. No concerns were expressed over the surrender period. The Firm has denied the claim as having no merit and I deny any wrongdoing.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE COMPLAINANT IS A 65 YEAR OLD WITH 100% OF HIS $1.3 MILLION IN ASSETS INVESTED IN EQUITIES. HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT MARKET RISK AND AFTER ANALYZING HIS SITUATION, I RECOMMENDED INVESTMENT OPTIONS AIMED AT DIVERSIFYING HIS PORTFOLIO AND REDUCING HIS RISK. HE CHOSE TO LIQUIDATE APPROXIMATELY 30% OF HIS EQUITIES AND PURCHASE AN EQUITY INDEXED ANNUITY, WHICH PROTECTS PRINCIPAL FROM MARKET RISK, IS TAX-DEFERRED AND OFFERS 10% PENALTY-FREE ACCESS PER YEAR. COMPLAINANT'S NEIGHBOR THEREAFTER ALLEGEDLY EXTORTED $250,000 FROM COMPLAINANT AND COMPLAINANT GOT THE FUNDS BY WITHDRAWING FROM HIS EIA, WHICH RESULTED IN A PENALTY. COMPLAINANT NOW ALLEGES THE ANNUITY WAS UNSUITABLE AND I SHOULD SOMEHOW HAVE STOPPED HIS NEIGHBOR'S EXTORTION. STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS REVIEWED THIS CASE AND HAVE TAKEN NO ACTION AGAINST ME. MY RECOMMENDATIONS WERE APPROPRIATE AND I DENY ANY WRONGDOING IN THIS MATTER.""

I presented a false ID to obtain an alcoholic beverage when I was 20 years old.  I was young and in school and made a decision that I regret to this day.  The mistake that I made 18 years ago does not reflect the man that I am today.""
