  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Soon after the client made the investment in August 2016, the parent company surprised everyone on a quarterly earnings call by saying that it would be willing to let this particular subsidiary go into bankruptcy.  The subsidiary had sold several hundred million dollar's worth of new issue bonds on August 1, 2016. Although it was an unfortunate loss, it was a small percentage of a very large, diversified portfolio.  The client understood my explanation and withdrew his complaint the next day.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""DUE TO HEAVY PAYDOWNS RELATED TO SEPT 11TH (3 ADDITIONAL RATE CUTS) THIS BOND PAID DOWN PRINCIPAL AT A MORE RAPID RATE THAN ANYONE EXPECTED-MUCH FASTER THAN CONSENSUS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. BECAUSE THE BOND WAS PURCHASED AT A PREMIUM OF 107 (MARKET PRICE AS OF AUGUST 2001, THE TIME OF PURCHASE) THE CLIENT WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE YIELD IT HAD EARNED TO THAT POINT (APPROXIMATELY 3 1/4%, STILL 150 BASIS POINTS HIGHER THAN FED FUNDS). I AGREED TO PURCHASE THE REMAINING ORIGINAL FACE AT A SLIGHT PREMIUM TO THE MARKET IN ORDER PLACATE THE CUSTOMER AND KEEP THEIR $40,000,000 ACCOUNT. UNFORTUNATELY I WAS NOT AWARE THAT MY ATTEMPT AT KEEPING A LARGE CUSTOMER HAPPY WAS GOING TO RESULT IN A PERMANENT U-4 COMPLAINT OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HANDLED DIFFERENTLY. THE CUSTOMER IS VERY HAPPY AND THE ACCOUNT IS STILL WITH ME.""
