  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In response to the activities alleged by the client, based on my recollection of events the client's allegations are inaccurate. The client is a sophisticated Recording Artist music producer and Real Estate investor. As such he is very familiar with contracts and the details involved in a contract. In regard to the annuities that he invested in, the prospectus was sent to both he and his attorney before the purchase of these solutions to peruse the details of the transaction. Corporate email records will confirm the delivery of the information being sent. Secondly there is the paperwork the client signed that detailed the fees and rate of return that was stated in the documents.  Santander required the information and signature from the client that stated rate of return and term of the contract and holding period required. Again all the forms were signed by the client as was required by compliance acknowledging the terms, riders, fees and rates of return.   After the purchase of two contracts the client stated that he wanted to invest more in these solutions and I stated that it was not the prudent thing to do as he should diversify his investment holdings and a mutual fund was purchased to further diversify his portfolio and provide him with income in retirement which was the stated goal of the annuity purchases. He is an owner of tenant occupied real estate and need to diversify his holdings and provide other incomes for retirement. These solutions that he invested in would provide that retirement income in addition to the rental income received and the mutual funds were a liquid solution.  Again in the Spring of 2017 I received a call from the client wanting to further invest in the annuity and once again I stated that he has enough of his wealth invested in annuities and should diversify into other types of investments. We discussed other types of investments and he stated he had invested in tech stocks as well. At this time I again explained his investments and received no notion that he did not understand or felt confused as to what he was invested in for his retirement needs. We did not do any further business together and I was quite shocked to receive this complaint as we have spent quite a bit of time discussing his needs and how these solutions met them. I feel that the email, signed paperwork, all which Santander has on file along with my many hours and discussion with the client will clarify I acted in a fiduciary manner in dealing with him. He is a sophisticated business person and has the background to understand what he was investing in.""
