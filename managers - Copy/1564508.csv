  ""Broker Comment"" : ""On 12/13/13 I lost my $180K salaried position as MD of Public Finance. The owners of the original b/d I joined had FINRA violations of which I was not aware. The PF div. was transitioned over to another broker dealer. The managing partner then decided to cut expenses and eliminated certain positions. I submitted my resume to over 400 potential employers from December 14th 2013 until today. I have held 1099 positions but have not recouped savings or been able to do more than to keep my credit card payments current. Between March 2014 and October 2015 I endured 5 major [REDACTED] and a case of [REDACTED]. On 9/29/18 my wife suffered 5 fractures of her [REDACTED] in a car accident.""
