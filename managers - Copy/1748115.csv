  ""Allegations"" : ""Merritt was named respondent in a FINRA complaint alleging that he participated in private securities transactions in which his customers invested a total of $115,000 in a speculative investment. The complaint alleges that Merritt did not provide written notice to his member firm prior to participating in these private securities transactions. The complaint also alleges that Merritt recommended that his customers invest in the speculative investment without having conducted adequate due diligence on it and without a reasonable basis to believe that an investment in it was suitable for any customer. The complaint further alleges that Merritt falsely represented in annual certification to his firm that he was complying with its policy prohibiting representatives from participating in private securities transactions.   The firm is uncomfortable supervising the representative based upon the recent findings in the FINRA enforcement action."",

The findings stated that Merritt completed an \""Associate Annual Attestations\"" required by the firm in which he falsely affirmed that he was complying with the firm's private securities transactions policy. The findings also stated at the time he recommended that customers purchase Class A Units of a publicly traded company, Merritt had not conducted an adequate investigation upon which to make a determination that the company was a suitable investment for any investor, and he did not have a reasonable basis to recommend the company to any customer. Merritt never reviewed the company's financial projections covering an unspecified 24-month period, did not conduct any research on its product, and did not obtain information on its executives; did not adequately review the company's Investment Summary in order to determine what a customer would own after purchasing a Class A Unit as defined by the Articles of Incorporation; and never requested, obtained, or reviewed other documents referenced in the Investment Summary that related to a business plan, product development specifications, technology and industry research, and marketing and sales strategies, all of which could be made available on request. In light of Merritt's financial status, no monetary sanction has been imposed."",
