  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN CLIENTS' LETTERS, THEY DISCUSSES AN EXCHANGE OF SOME MUTUAL FUNDS FOR SHARES OF THE CASH MANAGEMENT TRUST OF AMERICA WHEN INTENTION WAS TO INVEST IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  TO CLARIFY, THE CASH MANAGEMENT TRUST OF AMERICA IS A MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUND.  WHEN CLIENTS MOVED INVESTMENTS FROM OTHER MUTUAL FUNDS TO THE CASH MANAGEMENT TRUST OF AMERICA, THEY INVESTED IN MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS.  THEREFORE, WHILE WE REGRET ANY MISUNDERSTANDING CLIENTS MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED, THEIR WISHES WERE CARRIED OUT BY THE EXCHANGE.  CLIENTS ALSO RAISE A CONCERN REGARDING THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE CDS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS IN THE ACCOUNT.  GENERALLY, DIVERSIFICATION IS RECOMMENDED FOR ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING THE DIVERSIFICATION CAUSED BY LADDERING, OR VARYING MATURITIES, WHICH CAN HELP MANAGE REINVESTMENT AND LIQUIDITY RISKS, AS WELL AS OTHER RISKS.
