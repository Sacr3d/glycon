  ""Broker Comment"" : ""RESPONSE I RECEIVED AND READ THE E-MAIL ON FRIDAY, JAN. 23, 2009. I CALLED [THIRD PARTY] TO ASK HIM WHAT PROMPTED [CUSTOMER]TO WRITE THIS E-MAIL. [THIRD PARTY] RETURNED MY CALL ON TUESDAY, JAN. 27 ON A VOICEMAIL MESSAGE. I HAVE SAVED THE MESSAGE AND WILL RECORD IT. I ALSO PLAYED IT FOR [THIRD PARTY], [THIRD PARTY]& [THIRD PARTY].  HE APOLOGIZED FOR THE EMAIL. HE SAID WHAT HAPPENED, WAS WHEN SHE SAW THEIR PERSONAL TAX RETURN AND SAW THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR STOCK VALUES THAT SHE BECAME VERY UPSET. HE SAID IT WAS NOT MY FAULT, JUST THE MARKET. HE SAID SHE BLAMES ME, THE SYSTEM, THE INSTITUTION, ALL STOCK BROKERS & THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS RIGGED.  HE SAID SHE JUST \""VENTED\"". SHE WAS JUST ANGRY.  SHE SAID THE STOCK MARKET IS CROOKED, THAT THE BROKERS MAKE MONEY & WE LOSE. HE SAID HE CAN'T STOP HER FROM \""VENTING\"" BUT HE IS NOT MAD AT ME & SORRY THAT IT HAPPENED. [THIRD PARYT] ALSO RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM [THIRD PARTY]. I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG. [THIRD PARTY] WANTED GROWTH STOCKS UNTIL HE WAS AGE 65 AND THEN GO TO INCOME. I HAVE NOT CHURNED THIS ACCOUNT OR ANY OTHER ACCOUNT. I DOCUMENT EVERY SINGLE TRADE I MAKE. I ALSO SEND [THIRD PARTY]  AN E-MAIL ON TRADES AND ASK HIM TO CALL ME IF HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. HE HAS NEVER QUESTIONED A SINGLE INVESTMENT I MADE. [CUSTOMER] ALSO MENTIONED MY SON IN HER E-MAIL AND HE HAS NOT WORKED HERE FOR 5 1/2 YEARS AND DID NOT MAKE ANY DECISIONS ON THE ACCOUNTS. I HAVE NOT SEEN OR TALKED TO [CUSTOMER] FOR OVER SIX YEARS. [THIRD PARTY]HAS NOT ONLY BEEN A GOOD CLIENT BUT ALSO A VERY GOOD FRIEND AND HE UNDERSTANDS THE REASON FOR THE DECREASE IN VALUE & HAS NEVER QUESTIONED MY INTEGRITY.""
