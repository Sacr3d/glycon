  ""Broker Comment"" : ""2010 was a tough year for me as I went through my parent's divorce. I found refuge in the wrong company and when I turned 21 in June of 2011, my erroneous lifestyle took off and I was arrested for the possession of a controlled substance.   Honestly, It was exactly the wake up call I needed and I am thankful it happened. If it wasn't for that time period in my life, I don't know where I would be today. I have successfully completed an Outpatient Treatment Program for substance abuse and am a completely different person from who I was back then.  The case has been fully dismissed at this point.""
