  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CLIENT PURCHASED A NON-TRADED REIT ON APRIL 13, 2007.  IT WAS RECOMMENDED AS, AND INTENDED TO BE, PART OF A MUCH LARGER OVERALL PORTFOLIO FOR DIVERSIFICATION PURPOSES.  HOWEVER, HE ONLY MADE THIS SINGULAR INVESTMENT, WHICH WAS A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF HIS LIQUID NET WORTH.  THE CLIENT HAD 25 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE.  PRIOR TO PURCHASE, ALL RISKS (INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THE INVESTMENT MAY LOSE VALUE) AND FEES WERE DISCLOSED AND ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE CLIENT IN WRITING.""
