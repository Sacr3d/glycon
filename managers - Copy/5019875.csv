  ""Allegations"" : ""ALLEGED THAT AGENT SUBMITTED FALSE INFORMATION TO QUALIFY CLIENTS FOR INSURANCE PRODUCTS"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE FIRMS' ALLEGATIONS ARE UNTRUE AND COMPLETELY UNFOUNDED. THEY ARE DELIBERATELY VAGUE WITH NO SUPPORTING EVIDENCE OR DETAIL PROVIDED, FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:   1) MY ACTIONS WERE BASED ENTIRELY UPON SPECFIC INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN BY THE EMPLOYER, IN A CLASSROOM SETTING, BY AN EMPLOYER-AUTHORIZED PRESENTER.   2)THE PRACTICE OF SUBMITTING A TEMPORARY RANDOM FARM BUREAU MEMBER NUMBER (I.E. 9999999); REFERRED TO BY THE FIRM AS \""FALSE INFORMATION\"", CENTERED DIRECTLY UPON AN INTERNAL SYSTEM-DEFAULT OVERRIDE, NOT INSURANCE PRODUCTS. IN TRAINING, THE INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED THE REQUIREMENT OF ADDING THE FARM BUREAU MEMBER NUMBER PRIOR TO THE CLIENTS' POLICY RENEWAL DATE (HOME - 1YR AND AUTO - 6MOS) OR THE POLICY WOULD BE TERMINATED. I MAINTAINED FULL INTENT TO ADHERE TO THIS REQUIREMENT IN ORDER TO AVOID THAT PLIGHT FOR MY CLIENTS AND THE IMMINENT RESULTING COMPLAINTS.  3) MY ACTIONS DID NOT VIOLATE INDUSTRY REGULATIONS; INSURANCE, INVESTMENTS OR OTHERWISE AND DID NOT CAUSE, NOR RESULT IN ANY HARM, LOSS OR COMPLAINT ON THE PART OF ANY CLIENT.   4) THE EMPLOYER HAS GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS TO AGENTS ON FOLLOWING THE EXACT SAME PROCESS AND FOR THE SAME RESULT; TEMPORARY SYSTEM DEFAULT OVERRIDE. THE OVERRIDE SIMPLY ALLOWED FOR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE APPLICATONS TO BE RELEASED/FORWARDED TO UNDERWRITING, FOR REVIEW. I HAVE, IN MY POSSESSION, THE WRITTEN DIRECTIONS FROM MANAGEMENT AND WILL PROVIDE IMMEDIATELY, UPON REQUEST. EFFECTIVE 9/30/2010 THIS MATTER IS BEING ESCALATED, BY ME, FOR JUDGEMENT VIA ARBITRATION UNLESS FIRM TAKES ACTION TO REMOVE THIS FALSE ALLEGATION.""
