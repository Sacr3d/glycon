THE PROBLEM AROSE BECAUSE I PAID FOR MY INSURANCE RENEWAL BEFORE RECEIVING THE AFFIDAVIT BACK FROM KAPLAN VERIFYING MY COMPLETION OF CE.  THEREFORE THE STATE OF AL FELT THAT I ANSWERED FALSELY WHEN I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS ACTUALLY IN GOOD ORDER.  SINCE THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BUDGE ON THEIR RULES, I ELECTED TO SETTLE AND PAY THE FINE.""
