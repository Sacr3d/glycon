  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Dufresne consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he sold more than $1.6 million in unapproved fixed indexed annuities to five purchasers, two of whom were his member firm's customers, and earned more than $114,000 in commissions for these insurance transactions. The findings stated that Dufresne sought and received the firm's approval to engage in insurance brokerage as an outside business activity. However, the firm prohibited the sale of fixed indexed annuities as an outside business activity unless they were sold through and approved by the firm. Dufresne applied with a third party insurance company to become an independent agent, and he began selling two different fixed indexed annuities that had not been approved by the firm."",
