  ""Initiated By"" : ""UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""On April 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued the following Complaint in regards to Amro Izzelden Altahwi aka Andy Altahawi (\""Altahawi\"") and other defendants. Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission, for its Complaint against the Defendants that also included Longfin Corp., a company described by its CEO as an independent financial technology company that specializes in trade commodity solutions, alleges as follows:  This action concerns over $27 million in unregistered distributions of the stock of Longfin Corp. in a public distribution by Longfin affiliates between December 2017 and February 2018. Altahawi, and two other defendants conducted these sales in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. No exemption applied to these illegal transactions. Longfin and its Chairman and CEO, participated in and are liable for the Section 5 violations of Altahawi, and the other defendants. From June 16, 2017 through December 11, 2017, Longfin sold 1,140,989 shares pursuant to SEC Regulation A, a set of rules that allows issuers to publicly sell securities under procedures that are less burdensome than those that otherwise would apply if the sales were registered as required by Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. Pursuant to the Regulation A exemption from registration, Longfin was qualified to sell up to 10 million shares of its Class A common stock. On September 15, 2017, Longfin and its Chairman and CEO issued Altahawi 2,025,000 Class A common shares in consideration of purported legal and business consulting services performed by Altahawi. Altahawi's shares were restricted securities that could not be resold, except under limited circumstances. On December 13, 2017, Longfin's Class A shares began trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC. In connection with its voluntary Nasdaq listing, Longfin was required to register its shares pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Longfin's Section 12(b) registration required the company to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, including the requirement to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under Exchange Act Rule 13a-13. On or about December 15, 2017, Longfin announced its acquisition of a purported cryptocurrency business named \""Ziddu.com\"" from an entity at least 92%-owned by Longfin's Chairman and CEO. Although Ziddu.com had no ascertainable value, Longfin's stock price rose dramatically after it publicly announced the acquisition. Having registered its securities under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, Longfin was required to file a quarterly report on or before January 8, 2018. It failed to do so. Therefore, beginning on January 9, 2018, Longfin was out of compliance with its Exchange Act periodic reporting obligations. Longfin thereafter failed to file any quarterly or annual report until April 2, 2018, when it filed its annual report on Form 10-K for 2017. Between February 8, 2018 and March 23, 2018, Altahawi sold 475,751 shares of Longfin in the public market, consisting of both the 2,025,000 shares that he received on September 15, 2017 as purported compensation and 121,000 additional restricted shares that he received from ten individuals, one or more of whom were affiliated with Longfin. No registration statement was filed or in effect for these sales, and no Securities Act exemption applied to them. Altahawi reaped profits of over $25 million from these sales."",
