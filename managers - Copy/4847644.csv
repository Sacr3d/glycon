  ""Allegations"" : ""THE FIRM HAD IDENTIFIED SEVERAL QUESTIONABLE EXPENSE REPORT SUBMISSIONS. MR. PARRILLI RESIGNED BEFORE WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO QUESTION HIM ABOUT WHAT APPEARED TO BE DUPLICATE EXPENSE SUBMISSIONS."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED FROM PLANCO FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC (\""PLANCO\"") ON MAY 8, 2009.  MY RESIGNATION WAS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THIS ISSUE WITH DUPLICATE EXPENSE REPORTS.  IN FACT, MY MANAGER DID NOT TELL ME THAT THERE WERE DUPLICATE EXPENSE ITEMS UNTIL AFTER MY RESIGNATION.  IT APPEARS I MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY REQUESTED AND WAS REIMBURSED FOR THE SAME EXPENSE TWICE. (PLANCO HAS NEVER ACTUALLY SHARED WITH ME THE DETAILS OF WHAT I ALLEGEDLY DID WRONG).  IF A DUPLICATE EXPENSE REPORT WAS SUBMITTED, IT WAS COMPLETELY UNINTENTIONAL, AND I CERTAINLY NEVER INTENDED TO DEFRAUD PLANCO.  I AM WILLING TO IMMEDIATELY REPAY ANY MONEY THAT MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY BEEN OVER REIMBURSED TO ME BY PLANCO.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IN QUESTION IS LESS THAN $400.""
