  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I DENY THE ALLEGATIONS. ALL TRANSACTIONS WERE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE CLIENT(S). ON 9/28/07, I MET WITH THE CLIENTS AND A PRIVATE BANKER AND DISCUSSED THE CLIENTS' OBJECTIVES REGARDING 401K ROLLOVER INTO AN IRA. CLIENTS' WANTED A COMPETITIVE RATE, YET WANTED TO MAINTAIN A LOW RISK PROFILE. CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT (CDS) AND PREFERRED STOCK WERE DISCUSSED. SECOND MEETING WAS SCHEDULED TO DISCUSS SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS.  ON 10/4/07, I MET WITH THE HUSBAND AND DISCUSSED MY PROPOSAL (EQUAL INVESTMENTS IN A VARIABLE ANNUITY, CDS, AND PREFERRED STOCK). CLIENT ASKED ABOUT 100% PORTFOLIO IN PREFERRED STOCK AS THE CLIENT WAS SURE HIS WIFE WOULD WANT TO INVEST IN A VARIABLE ANNUITY, BUT WOULD BRING THE PROPOSAL HOME TO DISCUSS. LATER THAT DAY OR THE NEXT, THE HUSBAND CALLED & CONFIRMED THE PURCHASE OF THE PROPOSED PREFERRED STOCKS (100%), WHICH WERE PURCHASED ON 10/8/07.  THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS WERE INVESTED IN PREFERRED STOCK, WITH REMAINING MONEY IN A MONEY MARKET TO PAY DOWN SOME DEBT. I PURCHASED AS MANY ROUND LOTS AS I COULD AND THE REMAINING MONEY WAS ADDED TO MONEY MARKET. THE CLIENT HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL MONEY IN THE MONEY MARKET; THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MARKET PRICE AND EXECUTED PRICE; AND HOW TO ACCESS HIS ACCOUNTS ONLINE.  I EXPLAINED/ADDRESSED ALL OF HIS CONCERNS/QUESTIONS, INCLUDING HOW TO ACCESS HIS ACCOUNTS ONLINE. THE CLIENT INDICATED HE WAS AWARE HE WOULD PAY A COMMISSION, BUT DIDN'T REALIZE IT WOULD BE UP FRONT.    THE CLIENT NEVER IMPLIED THAT HE DID NOT GIVE PERMISSION TO PURCHASE THE PREFERRED STOCKS; THAT HE EXPECTED AN ADDITIONAL MEETING, TO INCLUDE HIS WIFE, PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE; OR THAT HE WANTED TO PURCHASE CDS. A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER THE PRIVATE BANKER CALLED INDICATING THAT THE CLIENTS HAD SOME CONCERNS AND WOULD LIKE TO MEET.  I MET WITH THE CLIENTS ON 11/6/07 WHERE THEY INDICATED THAT THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE THE FUNDS SPLIT EQUALLY BETWEEN CDS AND PREFERRED STOCK.""
