  ""Firm Name"" : ""UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Employee was discharged after firm review found she falsely attested to verbally confirming a disbursement request with a client, in violation of firm's disbursement policy."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""A situation happened in a client's account back in May of 2018. I made an internal journal from one account to another account to prevent a check from being returned in a client's account. This situation was a common occurrence with this particular client. He always gave us authorization to make this journal to cover the funds. For this occurrence, I received an email indicating that the check would be returned to the vendor by a certain time if the account was not replenished. I quickly transferred funds internally to avoid having the check returned. I confirmed the transaction with the client, however, it was after the journal was completed. No harm was done to the client or the firm.""
