THE STATE OF KANSAS MOVES A NON-RENEWED LICENSE INTO A 'SUSPENDED' STATUS UNTIL EITHER A) THE AGENT RENEWS THE LICENSE OR B) 90 DAYS PASSES (AT WHICH TIME THE LICENSE WOULD BE 'EXPIRED').  AGENT CHOSE TO RENEW THE LICENSE, WHICH WAS COMPLETED 8/20/2010.  A LATE FEE OF $100 WAS IMPOSED, PAID IN FULL 8/19/2010.""
