  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The allegations made in the claim were without merit and, in fact, false. The customer was a sophisticated high net worth entrepreneur knowledgeable about investments. After Mr. Kagele had managed the customer's investments for an extended period of time, the customer desired more control over his investments and started placing direct trades in an established account against the advice of Mr. Kagele. A reduced settlement amount was reached to mitigate ongoing legal expenses. Claimants have withdrawn claims against Respondent Mr. Kagele with prejudice in this matter.""
