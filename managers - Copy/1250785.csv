  ""Allegations"" : ""CLIENT ALLEGED THAT THREE VARIABLE ANNUITY INVESTMENTS (TOTALING $214,768) PURCHASED THROUGH A CFS REPRESENTATIVE BETWEEN OCTOBER AND DECEMBER OF 2013 WERE UNSUITABLE AND THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE FAILED TO FULLY DISCLOSE TAX CONSIDERATIONS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THE CLIENT HAS THEREFORE REQUESTED FOR THE VARIABLE ANNUITIES TO BE SURRENDERED WITHOUT PENALTY. WE DENY THE ALLEGATIONS. A CFS REVIEW REVEALED THAT ALL REQUIRED DISCLOSURES WERE MADE IN WRITING AND THAT THE SIGNED DOCUMENTATION SUPPORTS SUITABILITY FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS. CFS RESPONDED TO THE CLIENT IN WRITING WITH A SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND DENIAL OF COMPLAINT. DURING THE COMPLIANCE REVIEW, CFS NOTED THAT A CLERICAL ERROR WAS MADE BY THE REPRESENTATIVE IN COMPLETING PAPERWORK FOR ONE VA PURCHASE RESULTING IN A BENEFIT NOT BEING ADDED TO THE CONTRACT. CFS HAS AGREED TO COMPENSATE THE CLIENT FOR ANY COST APPLICABLE TO THE FULL SURRENDER FOR THE AFFECTED VA ($55,000 PURCHASE). AT THE TIME OF THIS FILING, THE CLIENT CONTINUES TO DISPUTE SUITABILITY BUT MAINTAINS THE 2 VA CONTRACTS WITH A DIFFERENT CFS REPRESENTATIVE ASSIGNED AS AGENT OF RECORD."",

SHE HAD AMPLE TIME TO CONSIDER HER INVESTMENT OPTIONS, ASK FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS, AND RAISE ANY CONCERNS BEFORE APPROVING THE PURCHASE OF THE VA.  REQUIRED DISCLOSURES AND DESCRIPTIONS WERE MADE BOTH VERBALLY AND THEN PROVIDED IN WRITING.  THE VA IS CLEARLY SUITABLE AND MET THE CLIENT'S STATED NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES.  FIRM RECORDS AND THE CLIENT'S SIGNED DOCUMENTATION DISPUTE HER CLAIMS. ACCORDINGLY, THE CLIENT'S REQUEST FOR SURRENDER WITHOUT CHARGES WAS DENIED.""
