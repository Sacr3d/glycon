  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Original U5 made no mention of any issues and was clean upon leaving Nationwide Securities LLC. Four months after leaving, Nationwide Securities LLC found out there was an investigation of fraud against them and FINRA had questioned me about Nationwide Securities LLC's illegal activities. In retaliation, Nationwide Securities LLC amended my U4 with the lie that I did not return files. I have 14 FedEx receipts that say Nationwide received said files.""
