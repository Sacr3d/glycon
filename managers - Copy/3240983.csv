  ""Broker Comment"" : ""A SERIOUSLY ILL CLIENT'S SISTER CALLED ME WITH THE CLIENT PRESENT REQUESTING GENERAL INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO ADDRESS AND PAYEE INSTRUCTIONS FOR A ROLLOVER CHECK GOING INTO MY CLIENT'S ACCOUNT.  I PROVIDED HER WITH THIS.  NO PERSONAL OR ACCOUNT INFORMATION WAS DISCLOSED DURING THE COURSE OF THE PHONE CALL.  ING TOOK ISSUE WITH THE FACT THAT I DID NOT OBTAIN PERMISSION FROM THE CLIENT AUTHORIZING ME TO SPEAK WITH HER SISTER ABOUT HER ACCOUNT.  THEY ALSO FELT THAT I DID NOT REVIEW THE CLIENT'S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.  THIS WAS A FAIRLY NEW CLIENT WHO WAS ULTRA CONSERVATIVE.  100% OF HER MONEY WAS IN A FIXED, INTEREST BEARING INVESTMENT.  THERE WAS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HER RISK TOLERANCE HAD CHANGED.  I COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH ING'S POINT OF VIEW IN REGARDS TO THIS MATTER.""
