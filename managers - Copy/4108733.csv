  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 22409, JULY 3, 2012: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS OBTAINED A COURT ORDER FREEZING THE ASSETS OF A GEORGIA-BASED INVESTMENT ADVISER WHO HAS APPARENTLY GONE INTO HIDING AFTER ORCHESTRATING A $40 MILLION INVESTMENT FRAUD.  THE SEC ALLEGES THAT AUBREY LEE PRICE RAISED MONEY FROM MORE THAN 100 INVESTORS LIVING PRIMARILY IN GEORGIA AND FLORIDA BY SELLING SHARES IN AN UNREGISTERED INVESTMENT FUND THAT HE MANAGED. PRICE PURPORTED TO INVEST FUND ASSETS IN TRADITIONAL MARKETABLE SECURITIES, BUT HE ALSO MADE ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS IN SOUTH AMERICA REAL ESTATE AND A TROUBLED SOUTH GEORGIA BANK. IN ORDER TO CONCEAL MOUNTING LOSSES OF INVESTOR FUNDS, PRICE CREATED BOGUS ACCOUNT STATEMENTS WITH FALSE ACCOUNT BALANCES AND RETURNS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO INVESTORS AND BANK REGULATORS.  THE SEC ALLEGES THAT PRICE BEGAN HIS SCHEME IN 2008. ACCORDING TO THE FUND'S PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM, THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE WAS TO ACHIEVE \""POSITIVE TOTAL RETURNS WITH LOW VOLATILITY\"" BY INVESTING IN A VARIETY OF OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING EQUITY SECURITIES TRADED ON THE U.S. MARKETS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF FUND INVESTOR FUNDS - APPROXIMATELY $36.9 MILLION - WAS PLACED IN A SECURITIES TRADING ACCOUNT AT A BROKER-DEALER. THE TRADING ACCOUNT SUFFERED MASSIVE TRADING LOSSES AND MONEY WAS FREQUENTLY WIRE-TRANSFERRED TO THE FUND'S OPERATING BANK ACCOUNT. THROUGHOUT THE TIME DURING WHICH THE FUND SUFFERED TRADING LOSSES, CLIENT ACCOUNT STATEMENTS PREPARED BY PRICE WERE MADE AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS INDICATING FICTITIOUS AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND INVESTMENT RETURNS.  ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S COMPLAINT, PRICE HAS SENT A LETTER TO SOME INDIVIDUALS DATED JUNE 2012 AND TITLED \""CONFIDENTIAL CONFESSION FOR REGULATORS - [THE FUNDS'] SUMMARY.\"" IN THE 22-PAGE LETTER, PRICE ADMITS THAT HE \""FALSIFIED STATEMENTS WITH FALSE RETURNS\"" IN ORDER TO CONCEAL BETWEEN $20 MILLION AND $23 MILLION IN INVESTOR LOSSES.  THE SEC'S COMPLAINT CHARGED PRICE AND HIS RELATED COMPANIES, WITH VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 10(B) AND OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND RULE 10B-5 THEREUNDER, AND FURTHER CHARGED PRICE AND ONE OF HIS COMPANIES WITH VIOLATIONS OF SECTIONS 206(1), (2) AND (4) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 AND RULE 206(4)-8 THEREUNDER.  THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE GRANTED THE SEC'S REQUEST FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND ENTERED AN ASSET FREEZE FOR THE BENEFIT OF INVESTORS AGAINST PRICE, THE FUND, AND HIS AFFILIATED ENTITIES. THE JUDGE HAS SCHEDULED A COURT HEARING ON JULY 13, 2012 FOR THE SEC'S MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION."",
