  ""Firm Name"" : ""TRAJAN WEALTH, LLC"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""It was discovered that Ms. Mackenzie had been selling fixed annuity products away from Trajan Wealth, LLC while still representing herself as being with Trajan Wealth, LLC. This happened over a roughly 3 year period as the firm has found so far, with the commissions being deposited in to her personal bank account rather than going through Trajan Wealth, LLC. So far it appears that approximately $3 million in annuities was sold away from Trajan Wealth, LLC, however the internal review is still ongoing. The firm is consulting with outside counsel to assist with the ongoing review and potential litigation proceedings of Ms. Mackenzie."",
