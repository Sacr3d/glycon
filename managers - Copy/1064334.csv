The Commission finds that on November 16, 2017, a final judgment was entered by consent against Kohli, permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Peter R. Kohli, et al., Civil Action Number 5:16-cv-05143, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.   The Commission's complaint alleges that while Kohli solicited investors to invest in the four mutual funds run by The DMS Funds, he instead used the money for other purposes. To conceal this fraud, Kohli sent investors fake financial statements purporting to show their investments in the mutual funds. The complaint also alleges that Kohli made materially false statements in soliciting the sale of the securities of DMS Advisors' parent company, and made material misrepresentations and omissions in mutual fund registration statements filed with the Commission."",

  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Litigation Release No. 23659, September 28, 2016: The SEC announced charges and an emergency asset freeze against a former stockbroker for defrauding investors in his failing mutual fund business. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that, from 2012 through 2015, Peter R. Kohli, of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, fraudulently raised more than $3.2 million from at least 120 investors. The complaint alleges that, among other things, Kohli filed false mutual fund registration statements with the SEC, misappropriated investor funds, and made false and misleading statements when selling securities in a company controlled by Kohli. At the time of his misconduct, Kohli was a registered representative and investment adviser representative associated with a dually-registered broker-dealer and investment adviser. According to the SEC's complaint, in 2012, Kohli launched a fund (the \""Fund\""), which ultimately consisted of four emerging market mutual fund series. An advisory firm (the \""Firm\"") was the Funds' investment adviser, and a separate Kohli-controlled company (the \""Company\"") owned the Firm. The complaint alleges that Kohli filed registration statements with the SEC that falsely overstated the Funds' sophistication and ignored the key risk that the Firm and Kohli would be unable to pay the funds' expenses, sold the Company warrants, falsely telling investors that the Company had taken steps toward an initial public offering, stole money meant to be invested in the mutual funds, and used it instead to pay fund expenses and, as the funds neared collapse, lied to investors and sold the Company promissory notes with no reasonable expectation that the purchasers could be repaid. The SEC's complaint charges Kohli with violations of Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940."",
