  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Apted consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he participated in investors' private securities transactions in a certain venture-capital fund through another member firm without notifying his member firm at the time, about those transactions or his role in them. The findings stated that after Apted decided to change firms but before he moved, the two investors expressed interest to Apted in investing in the venture-capital fund. Although Apted's firm at the time offered that fund, Apted referred the investors to the other firm for the purpose of investing in the fund. The investors collectively invested more than $300,000 in the fund through the other firm and Apted advised and assisted the investors with transactions. The firm prohibited its associated persons from participating in private securities transactions, and Apted had attested on three occasions that he would comply with that policy. The findings also stated that Apted disclosed nonpublic information about customers to another firm without their consent and did not notify the firm that he was sharing the nonpublic information. Apted communicated about his securities business using a personal email account that his firm could not supervise. The findings also included that even though the firm prohibited using a Twitter account without approval, Apted used a Twitter account to send tweets about his securities business without pursuing or receiving a qualified registered principal's approval. Also, Apted did not provide copies of those tweets to the firm so that it could retain them."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In the process of resigning from Smith Moore and transferring to his new firm, the broker tried to accommodate the client and friend by having his new firm facilitate the client's investment in iSelect Fund.  The broker did not know that this is a technical rule violation and the broker only intended to make the onerous transfer of private equity easier for his client, who is also a very good friend and long-time client of the broker.  The iSelect Fund investment has been very profitable for the client and the client was very appreciative of the broker's efforts to help him.""
