  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I AM VERY SURPRISED AT THIS COMPLAINT. [CUSTOMER] WAS A LONG TIME CLIENT, OF OVER 6 YEARS. WITHOUT FULL DETAILS, AND REGARDING THE AFOREMENTIONED 'VUL', I AM ONLY ABLE TO PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING: FROM THE INITIAL CONSULTATION, THROUGH DATA GATHERING, SUBSEQUENT STRATEGY MEETINGS, AND RECOMMENDATION / IMPLEMENTATION SESSIONS, I WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A DISTRICT MANAGER (WHO WAS MY PERSONAL COACH AND TEAM LEADER). A FINANCIAL PLAN WAS CREATED AND ANALYSIS PERFORMED. BASED ON THE DATA AND CURRENT EVENTS AT THAT TIME, THE RECOMMENDATION WAS DEEMED SUITABLE. BOTH MYSELF, AND MY DISTRICT MANAGER WERE PRESENT TO PROVIDE FULL DISCLOSURE AND CONFIRM THE CLIENT'S COMPREHENSION AND UNDERSTANDING OF ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. PRIOR TO LEAVING, I MET WITH [CUSTOMER] AND SPOUSE, LET THEM KNOW OF MY LEAVING, AND REMINDED THEM TO KEEP AN ONGOING EYE ON THE VUL, AS TO NOT LEAVE IT NEGLECTED, ALONG WITH OTHER CASUAL AND RAPPORT BASED TOPICS RELAVANT TO MY LEAVING OF FORMER B/D.""
