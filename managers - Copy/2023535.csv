THUS, OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, TURNES HAS ANSWERED \""YES\"" TO QUESTIONS 14D(1)(B) & (D).

IN MOST OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH TURNES, ACQUIRED THE BONDS FROM ITS BANK OR INSURANCE AFFILIATES AND THEN SOLD THEM AT A MARKUP FROM THAT PRICE TO A CUSTOMER AT A PRICE OF 8% OR MORE ABOVE THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE OF THE BONDS. IN THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH TURNES, BOUGHT THE BONDS FROM CUSTOMERS AT PRICES OF 8% OR MORE BELOW THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE OF THE BONDS AND THEN SOLD THE BONDS AT A SLIGHT MARKUP FROM THAT PRICE TO ITS BANK OR INSURANCE AFFILIATES. THE EXCESSIVE MARKUPS/MARKDOWNS ON THE TRANSACTIONS RANGED FROM 23.58% TO 8.03%. THE CHARGES IN EXCESS OF THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICES TOTALED $124,644.02. TURNES' FAILURE TO PROPERLY PRICE THE BONDS CAUSED THE FIRM TO CHARGE, AND ITS CUSTOMERS TO BE CHARGED, EXCESSIVE MARKUPS/MARKDOWNS ON THE TRANSACTIONS. THE CONFIRMATIONS AND ACCOUNT STATEMENTS PROVIDED TO THE CUSTOMERS DID NOT DISCLOSE THE EXCESSIVE NATURE OF THE MARKUPS/MARKDOWNS; THE FIRM AND TURNES ALSO FAILED TO OTHERWISE DISCLOSE THOSE MARKUPS/MARKDOWNS TO THE CUSTOMERS. THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH TURNES, OBTAINED MONEY BY MEANS OF AN OMISSION TO STATE A MATERIAL FACT IN ORDER TO MAKE STATEMENTS MADE, NOT MISLEADING, ALSO ENGAGED IN TRANSACTIONS WHICH OPERATED AS A FRAUD OR DECEIT UPON THE CUSTOMERS. IN CORPORATE BOND TRANSACTIONS OVER THREE YEARS, THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH TURNES, CHARGED UNFAIR PRICES TO CUSTOMERS. TURNES DETERMINED THE PRICE. IN SOME OF THE TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM BOUGHT THE BONDS FROM A CUSTOMER AT AN UNFAIR PRICE AND SOLD THEM TO EITHER ITS BANK OR INSURANCE AFFILIATES OR BOUGHT THE BONDS FROM ONE OF THE AFFILIATES AND THEN SOLD THEM TO ANOTHER CUSTOMER AT AN UNFAIR PRICE. IN THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM BOUGHT THE BONDS FROM THE STREET AND THEN SOLD THEM TO A CUSTOMER AT AN UNFAIR PRICE OR BOUGHT THE BONDS FROM A CUSTOMER AT AN UNFAIR PRICE AND SOLD THEM TO THE STREET. IN SOME OF THE TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM CHARGED MARKUPS/MARKDOWNS OF 5% OR MORE. THE EXCESSIVE CHARGES ON ALL OF THE TRANSACTIONS TOTALED $336,472.03."",
