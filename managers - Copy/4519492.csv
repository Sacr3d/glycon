  ""Broker Comment"" : ""March 21, 2019:  After completing her payment plan, the Chapter 13 was converted to a Chapter 7 on April 30, 2012 to discharge all remaining debtors who had not previously made claims under the Chapter 13. Discharge of the debts under Chapter 7 was issued on August 1, 2012. The representative did not update this matter on her Form U4 because she was instructed by her prior firm, Zions Direct, that no update was required. October 30, 2009: On or about August 2007, RR became disabled for a period of time during which she incurred significant medical bills.  As a result, RR had to declare Chapter 13 bankruptcy in order to obtain a payment plant that would allow her to pay off her medical bills.""
