  ""Allegations"" : ""NASD RULES 2110, 3010, 3040(C): MCADAMS, HIS MEMBER FIRM, AND ANOTHER PRINCIPAL OF THE FIRM, FAILED TO REASONABLY SUPERVISE THE PARTICIPATION OF ONE OF THE FIRM'S REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES IN PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FIRM HAD RECEIVED PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE OF AND APPROVED, AND FAILED TO RECORD THESE TRANSACTIONS ON THE FIRM'S BOOKS AND RECORDS. MCADAMS IS THE CHAIRMAN AND SOLE OWNER OF THE FIRM. MCADAMS WAS THE PERSON DESIGNATED WITH THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE AT THE FIRM COULD ENGAGE IN PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS. MCADAMS, ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM, ENTERED INTO A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH A BUSINESS ENTITY, OWNED BY A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRM, FOR THE SALE OF 100% OF THE STOCK OF THE FIRM. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED MCADAMS AND ANOTHER PRINCIPAL, IN WRITING AND ORALLY, THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE NEEDED TO RAISE FUNDS TO OPERATE THE BRANCH OFFICE OF THE FIRM WHERE THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS WORKING, AND IN ORDER TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF THE FIRM. AFTER THE EXECUTION OF THE AGREEMENT, MCADAMS AND THE PRINCIPAL, ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM, APPROVED OF THE REPRESENTATIVE'S PARTICIPATION IN PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS TO RAISE MONEY THROUGH THE REPRESENTATIVE'S BUSINESS ENTITY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF PROMISSORY NOTES. THE REPRESENTATIVE RAISED $980,000 FROM THE SALE OF PROMISSORY NOTES ISSUED BY THE REPRESENTATIVE'S BUSINESS ENTITY TO SOME INDIVIDUALS. MCADAMS, HIS FIRM AND THE PRINCIPAL, FAILED TO SUPERVISE THE REPRESENTATIVE'S PARTICIPATION IN THE PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AS IF THEY WERE TRANSACTIONS OF THE FIRM OR IN A MANNER REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLIED TO THE REPRESENTATIVE'S PRIVATE SECURITIES SALES AWAY FROM THE FIRM. MOREOVER, MCADAMS, HIS FIRM, AND THE PRINCIPAL, FAILED TO ENSURE THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE'S PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS WERE RECORDED ON THE BOOKS OF THE FIRM."",
