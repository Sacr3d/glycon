I BELIEVE THAT THIS CLAIM IS THE RESULT OF A CONTINUED COURSE OF CONDUCT ON BEHALF OF BAI AND [THIRD PARTY] THAT VIOLATES A CONTRACT I ENTERED WITH BAI ON AUGUST 23, 2005 AND THAT TORTIOUSLY DEFAMES ME AND INTERFERES WITH MY LEGITIMATE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH MY CLIENTS.  THIS WRONGFUL CONDUCT ON BEHALF OF BAI AND [THIRD PARTY], INCLUDING THE CUSTOMER COMPLAINT THAT IS THE BASIS FOR THIS U4, IS THE SUBJECT OF A LAWSUIT PENDING IN THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANDERSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE, DOCKET NUMBER A6ALA0392.  BY SIGNING THIS U4 UNDER PROTEST, I IN NO WAY WAIVE ANY CLAIMS AGAINST BAI AND/OR [THIRD PARTY], AND I DO NOT AGREE TO ANY FORM OF ARBITRATION BEFORE THE NASD OR ANY OTHER BODY WITH BAI AND/OR [THIRD PARTY] REGARDING ANY CLAIM RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THIS U4 OR TO THE LAWSUIT PENDING IN THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANDERSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE.  I HAVE SIGNED THIS U4 ONLY BECAUSE MY EMPLOYER, RAYMOND JAMES, REQUIRES ME TO DO SO.""
