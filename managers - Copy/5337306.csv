  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I PURCHASED MY HOME IN LAS VEGAS, NEVADA AT THE PEAK OF THE HOUSING MARKET, AND SINCE THEN, MY JOB HAS MOVED ME ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO THE EAST COAST IN NORTH CAROLINA AND NOW GEORGIA.  I TRIED TO SELL MY HOME TO NO AVAIL WHEN I MOVED, AND OVER THE LAST 3 YEARS I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RENT AND LEASE MY HOME.  I HAVE ENCOUNTERED MUCH MORE TROUBLE THAN I COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE IN THIS PROCESS.  WHILE THE RENT DID NOT COVER THE MORTGAGE PAYMENT, I CONTINUED TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE TO MEET MY OBLIGATIONS.  HOWEVER, I ENCOUNTERED TENANTS THAT DESTROYED AND TRASHED MY HOME FOR MORE THAN $5000; TENANTS THAT DID NOT MAKE PAYMENTS; AND TENANTS THAT BROKE LEASES.  DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES FROM 2500 MILES AWAY HAS BEEN VERY CHALLENGING. IN ADDITION, THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND HOUSING MARKET FALLOUT HAS ADDED TO THE STRESS OF MY CURRENT SITUATION.  WORKING IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT ON WHAT I DO.  IN ADDITION, HOUSING VALUES HAVE PLUMMETED WITH MY HOME CURRENTLY VALUED AT ONE THIRD OF WHAT I PURCHASED AND OWE.   THE CULMINATION OF ALL THESE CHANGES - JOB RELOCATION, UNWORTHY TENANTS, AND THE ECONOMIC AND HOUSING DOWNTURN - HAS RESULTED IN THIS SHORTSALE.""
