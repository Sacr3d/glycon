  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I MET WITH THE CLIENT ON A WEEKLY BASIS SINCE OUR INTRODUCTION MARCH OF 2007.  THE CLIENT IS A SOPHISTICATED INVESTOR AND HAD INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE WITH STOCKS, BONDS, MUTUAL FUNDS, MONEY MARKETS, CD'S, REAL ESTATE, COMMODITIES, AND OPTIONS.  THE CLIENT'S PRIMARY JOB IS REAL ESTATE ACQUISTION AND DEVELOPMENT.  THE CLIENT UNDERSTOOD THE REVERSE CONVERTIBLE INVESTMENTS, AND ALL DISCLOSURES WERE MADE TO THE CLIENT, HIS DAUGHTER AND HIS FULL TIME BOOKKEEPER.  THE CLIENT HAS SAID TO ME, \""I KNEW THE BONDS COULD CONVERT TO STOCK, I WAS JUST HOPING THEY WOULDN'T\"".  I BELIEVE BECAUSE THE CLIENT LOST VALUE IN HIS INVESTMENTS, HE HAS MADE THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE OF THE LOSSES.  HAD THE INVESTMENTS BEEN A POSITIVE GAIN, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT WITH THE REVERSE CONVERTIBLE INVESTMENTS.  THE LAST SEVERAL MEETINGS I ASKED THE CLIENT TO BRING IN DAUGHTER OR BOOKKEEPER TO EACH MEETING AND ENCOURAGED THEM TO TAKE NOTE.  THE CLIENT IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN INVESTOR, WHICH UNDERSTANDS RISK, TOOK ON RISK, AND DECIDED HE DID NOT LIKE THE RESULTS.  I PROVIDED ALL NECESSARY DISCLOSURES, MADE SURE THE CLIENT UNDERSTOOD THE RISK TO PRINCIPAL, REVIEWED HIS GOALS AND OBJECTIVES, DOCUMENTED HIS RISK TOLERANCE, NET-WORTH, INCOME, FINANCIAL NEEDS AND EXPLAINED IN DETAIL THE STRUCTURE OF THE INVESTMENT.""
