  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE ALLEGATIONS MADE BY CUSTOMER ARE COMPLETELY FALSE.  WHEN HE CONTACTED ME IN '96 TO OPEN HIS ACCOUNT HE INDICATED HE HAD OTHER, MORE-CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENTS AND HIS INTENSION WITH THIS ACCOUNT WAS TO INVEST IN SMALL-CAP STOCKS. HIS NEW ACCOUNT FORM WAS IN FACT MARKED \""AGGRESSIVE\"", AND WE DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT SMALL COMPANY STOCKS INVOLVE GREATER RISK.  I INVESTED IN MOST OF THE SAME STOCKS CUSTOMER WAS IN. IT IS DOCUMENTED THAT OTHER, MORE CONSERVATIVE IDEAS WERE SENT TO CUSTOMER.  IN 1997 CUSTOMER RETURNED A REPLY FORM SAYING HE WAS VERY PLEASED.  IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE MARKET FOR SMALL-CAPS DECLINED IN '98 THAT HE CHANGED HIS MIND.  06/02/1999 - SENT LETTER TO CUSTOMER DENYING COMPLAINT ALLEGATIONS. NO FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM CUSTOMER.""
