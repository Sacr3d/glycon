  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Admin Releases 33-8233, 34-47829; IA Release 40-2127, May 12, 2003: The SEC instituted public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 against Jeffrey R. Patterson on November 14, 2002. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission's jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as to Jeffrey R. Patterson. On the basis of this Order and Respondent's Offer, the Commission finds that Respondent sold securities issued by an individual that held himself out to his customers, most of whom were financial institutions, as a broker of bank-issued, federally-insured certificates of deposit (CDs). The individual in fact bought CDs with customer funds. However, the individual's customers did not acquire a direct ownership interest in these CDs. Instead, beginning at least in 1996, the individual issued to the customers separate instruments, which were securities in the form of notes or investment contracts. These securities promised to pay interest rates and had maturity dates that varied from those terms in the underlying CDs. In many instances, the individual bought long-term CDs and issued shorter-term securities to his customers. Consequently, buyers of the individual's securities depended upon him, rather than the bank that issued the underlying CD, for the return of their principal. From at least 1996 until October 2001, Respondent sold the individual's securities. Respondent represented to customers that a company he was employed by was a CD broker and that the customers would be buying bank-issued, federally-insured CDs. What customers had bought in fact was a security issued by the individual. Respondent knew or should have known that the maturities of the CDs bought by the individual with customer funds were frequently longer than those of the instruments he was selling to customers. Respondent also knew or should have known that, from time to time, the individual paid interest rates on the instruments he issued that were higher than the rates paid by the CDs he bought with customer funds. However, Respondent did not disclose these facts to customers when he sold the individual's securities. Customers were led to believe that their transactions were being made through a registered broker-dealer. A sales brochure provided to and used by Respondent to solicit new customers made statements that created the mis-impression that Respondent's customers were making transactions through a registered broker-dealer. As a result of this conduct, Respondent willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder."",
