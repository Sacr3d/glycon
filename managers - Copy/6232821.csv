  ""Broker Comment"" : ""A POLICE OFFICER WAS BEHIND ME WHILE I WAS AT A GAS STATION. UNFORTUNATELY I DID NOT KNOW HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO PULL ME OVER SO I BEGAN TO DRIVE AWAY. AFTER A FEW MOMENTS AND FINALLY NOTICING HIM IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR I PROCEED TO STOP AND PULL OVER. THE WHOLE INCIDENT LASTED NO MORE THEN A LENGTH OF A FOOTBALL FIELD. HE ARRESTED ME FOR A FELONY WHICH WAS LATER REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR AND GAVE ME TWO TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS. IT WAS A MISTAKE THAT I CAN SAY I LEARNED A LOT FROM.""
