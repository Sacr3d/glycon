  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MY POSITION REQUIRED ME TO ASSIST ALL PNC CUSTOMERS, PNC BANK AND PNC INVESTMENTS.  I WAS ASSISTING A PNC BANK CUSTOMER AND REVIEWING THE FEES CHARGED TO THEIR FDIC INSURED DEPOSIT ACCOUNT.  I WAS THE ONLY STAFF MEMBER AVAILABLE AT THE TIME TO HELP RESOLVE THE CUSTOMER ISSUE.  AN INVESTMENT CONVERSATION WAS NOT HELD WITH THIS CUSTOMER.  LATER, IN A CONVERSATION WITH MY SPOUSE I DISCLOSED THE IDENTITY, AND ONLY THE IDENTITY, OF THIS BANK CUSTOMER.  THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT A CLIENT OF PNC INVESTMENTS, NOR HAD THEY EVER BEEN A CLIENT OF PNC INVESTMENTS. THERE WAS NOT AN INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY A LICENSED PNC INVESTMENT SUPERVISOR, RATHER A PNC BANK HUMAN RESOURCE STAFF MEMBER CONDUCTED THE INTERVIEW.  DURING THE FIRST PHONE CONVERSATION WITH THE PNC BANK HUMAN RESOURCE STAFF MEMBER I, WITHOUT HESITATION, ADMITTED TO DISCLOSING THE CUSTOMERS IDENTITY TO MY SPOUSE.""
