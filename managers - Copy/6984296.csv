  ""Broker Comment"" : ""When the economy took a downturn in 2008, my husband had a short-sale on his individual condo obtained prior to marriage and he also became unemployed that year, which left me responsible for all of our bills combined. I had to sell my property to make ends meet since I no longer received support from his end. When my condo was put on the market, the current market value was not enough to pay the existing loan, so I had to do a short-sale.""
