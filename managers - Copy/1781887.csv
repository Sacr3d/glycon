  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT BEGAN IN THE FALL OF 2008 HAD A DRAMATIC AND DEVASTATING EFFECT ON MY BUSINESS. AT THE TIME I WAS THE OWNER OF SPAGNOLI FINANCIAL GROUP AND AN OWNER OF CUAS A COMPANY THAT WAS WORKING WITH CREDIT UNIONS. THESE TWO COMPANIES REQUIRED $40,000 TO $60,000 PER MONTH FOR MARKETING EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, AND OVERHEAD INCLUDING OFFICE LEASES.  I WAS GENERATING THIS MONEY THROUGH MY BUSINESS AS A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. WHEN THINGS BASICALLY STOPPED IN THE ECONOMY IN THE END OF 2008 I TRIED TO HANG ON. AS 2008 LED INTO 2009 MY INCOME HAD DROPPED BY OVER 80%. I WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO MAINTAIN MY OFFICE OR MY FULL STAFF.  IN 2009 I LAID OFF MY STAFF AND MOVED OUT OF MY OFFICE INTO MY HOME OFFICE. 2009 THEN LED TO 2010 WITH NO REAL SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT.  ALL OF MY INCOME WAS GOING TOWARD DEBT SERVICE. IN 2011 WE WERE NO LONGER ABLE TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE DEBT SERVICE AND FORCED TO FILE CHAPTER 7. OUR HOME THAT WE HAD PURCHASED IN 2005 WITH 25% DOWN WAS WORTH 40% OF ITS VALUE AND WAS SOLD IN DEC 2011 AS A SHORT SALE. AS OF JAN 2012 THE BANKRUPTCY HAS FINALLY CLOSED AND WE ARE MOVING FORWARD.""
