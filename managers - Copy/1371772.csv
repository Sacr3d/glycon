  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CLIENTS, [CUSTOMERS], HAD COMPLETED & SIGNED A FINANCIAL PLANNING QUESTIONNAIRE AS WAS MR. MCCARTHY'S STANDARD PRACTICE, STATING THEIR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE WAS INCOME WITH POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH OF CAPITAL.  MR. MCCARTHY ACTED PRUDENTLY & REASONABLY & BASED HIS RECOMMENDATIONS TO THEM ON THEIR RESPONSES.  THEIR ANSWERS NEITHER INDICATED CHANGES IN LIFESTYLE NOR THAT THE 2 INVESTMENTS WOULD COMPRISE SUCH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF INVESTABLE NET WORTHIN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THEIR LATER ASSERTIONS.  THE INVESTMENTS WERE 2 NON-LEVERAGED TRIPLE NET LEASE HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE TENANT REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS WITH INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES THAT MATCHED THOSE OF THE [CUSTOMERS].  WELL IN ADVANCE OF THEIR PURCHASE, THE [CUSTOMERS] RECEIVED PROSPECTUSES THAT CLEARLY INDICATED COMMISSIONS ON THE FRONT COVERS.  SMITH BARNEY (SB), THE BROKER-DEALER & MR. MCCARTHY'S EMPLOYER, HAD PROPERLY REGISTERED THE INVESTMENTS WITH REGULATORY BODIES.  $22,000 WAS INVESTED BETWEEN THE 2 PARTNERSHIPS.  LATER, THE CLIENTS ALLEGED THAT THE INVESTMENTS WERE INAPPROPRIATE & MADE WITHOUT PROPER DISCLOSURES.  MR. MCCARTHY GAVE THE DOCUMENTATION FOR HIS RECOMMENDATION TO SB WHO THEN UNILATERALLY REMOVED MR. MCCARTHY'S NAME FROM THE COMPLAINT.  THE AMOUNT IN QUESTION WAS RELATIVELY SMALL, & SB CHOSE TO SETTLE & PAY $18,000 TO THE [CUSTOMERS] FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS RATHER THAN ARBITRATE.  AS MR. MCCARTHY WAS NO LONGER LEGALLY PART OF THE DISPUTE, HE HAD NO SAY IN THE SETTLEMENT DECISION NOR DID HE PAY ANY OF IT.""
