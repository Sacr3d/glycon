  ""Allegations"" : ""MR. ROSSI SUBMITTED AN EXPENSE REPORT IN WHICH HE CLAIMED TO HAVE HOSTED A BUSINESS DINNER.  SUBSEQUENTLY IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT NONE OF THE NAMED ATTENDEES WERE PRESENT.  THE EXPENSE REPORT WAS, THEREFORE, OVERSTATED BY $466."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON THE EVENING OF MAY 19TH 2005, I WAS TO HOST A FEW ADVISORS AT BROTHER JIMMIES BBQ. THE ATTENDEES WERE TO BE GLENN SCHWARZKOPF, FRANK QUARTARARO, ANDREW VAHAB AND TWO FRIENDS FROM THE AREA. THE ATTENDEES WERE ADVISORS FROM CITICORP INVESTOR SERVICES. THE EVENT HAD BEEN SCHEDULED IN ADVANCE. EARLIER THAT DAY, ANDREW VAHAB HAD INFORMED ME HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ATTEND BECAUSE HE NEEDED TO STUDY FOR AN EXAM. APPROXIMATELY 8:00, I PROCEEDED TO BROTHER JIMMIES BBQ FOR DINNER WHERE I WAS TO MEET FRANK, GLENN AND TWO FRIENDS FROM THE AREA. WHILE WE WERE HAVING DINNER, GLENN CALLED TO INFORM ME THAT HE AND FRANK WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ATTEND DINNER BUT MIGHT STOP BY LATER FOR A DRINK. AFTER WE FINISHED DINNER AND RECEIVED NO PHONE CALL FROM GLENN, I PAID THE BILL AT 10:18 AND RETURNED TO MY HOTEL. \\tI HAD LISTED THIS DINNER AS A BUSINESS EXPENSE BECAUSE I WAS ALREADY AT THE RESTAURANT HAVING DINNER WHEN THE ATTENDEES UNEXPECTEDLY CALLED TO TELL ME THEY COULD NOT MAKE DINNER. I WAS WAITED THERE FOR THEM UNTIL 10:18 PM; I RECEIVED NO CALL FROM GLENN OR FRANK THAT THEY WERE SHOWING UP LATER FOR A DRINK LIKE THEY INTENDED. THE PURPOSE OF THE DINNER WAS CLIENT BASED. SINCE I HAD TO PAY $118.94 FOR THE EVENING FOR AN EVENT THAT ONLY MATERIALIZED BECAUSE THE ADVISORS HAD AGREED TO ATTEND, I DECIDED TO EXPENSE THE DINNER. \\tI WAS UNABLE TO CANCEL MY HOTEL FOR THE EVENING BECAUSE THE MURRAY HILL EAST HOTEL HAS A 24 HOUR CANCELLATION POLICY. I WAS ALSO UNABLE TO CHANGE TO AN EARLIER FLIGHT TO RETURN TO BOSTON BECAUSE THE LAST FLIGHT ON USAIR LEFT LAGUARDIA AIRPORT AT 9:00 PM THAT EVENING. I HAVE ENCLOSED THE RECEIPTS FOR THE DINNER AT BROTHER JIMMIES BBQ AS WELL AS THE RECEIPT FROM THE MURRAY HILL EAST HOTEL.""
