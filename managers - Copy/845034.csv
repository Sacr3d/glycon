  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN 1987 I WAS A LESSEE IN AN OFFICE OWNED BY DESANTO & ASSOCIATES, WHICH WAS A GENERAL PARTNER FOR VARIOUS LIMITED PARTNERSHIUPS (LPS). FOR A PERIOD OF 18 MONTHS I REFERRED SOME OF MY INSURANCE CLIENTS, FOR A FEE, TO THESE LPS. I PERSONALLY INVESTED IN 3 LPS AND LOST $14,000. MY BUSINESS ACTIVITY WAS DEVOTED TO THE FULL TIME SALE OF LIFE INSURANCE FOR THE GUARDIAN. I WAS ENCOURAGED BY MR. DESANTO TO INTRODUCE MY INSURANCE CLIENTS TO SERVICES PROVIDED BY HIS FIRM. I INVITED  SELECTED POLICY HOLDERS TO ATTEND SEMINARS CONDUCTED BY MR. DESANTO WHO WERE OFFERED THE CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN HIS PROGRAMS. I DID NOT FEE I WAS VIOLATING ANY RULES AND HAD NO IDEA THAT THESE PARTNERSHIPS WERE UNREGISTERED SECURITIES.""
