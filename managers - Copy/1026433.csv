  ""Broker Comment"" : ""**UPDATE - THIS DISCLOSURE IS NO LONGER REPORTABLE ON THE CURRENT U4 BECAUSE IT WAS FILED MORE THAN 24 MONTHS AGO AND DID NOT SETTLE FOR $15,000 OR MORE**                  10/2008 THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR (FA) CONTACTED THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT TO DISCUSS CLIENT'S CASE AND PROFILE CONCERNING HER DESIRE TO 1035 EXCHANGE HER VARIABLE ANNUITY.  A FIXED ANNUITY WITH A LONG TERM CARE (LTC) RIDER WAS CONSIDERED.  THE INSURANCE SPECIALISTS RECOMMENDED AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY - COMBINING AN IMMEDIATE ANNUITY AND A GUARANTEED UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICY WITH A LTC RIDER SINCE THIS PROVIDED A SAFE, LIFETIME PAYMENT WITH A TEN YEAR PERIOD CERTAIN FROM THE IMMEDIATE ANNUITY WITH INTEGRITY LIFE AND A DEATH BENEFIT WITH AN ACCELERATED BENEFIT RIDER FOR LTC FROM JOHN HANCOCK.  IN 11/2008 THIS STRATEGY WAS PRESENTED TO THE CLIENT AND SHE DIRECTED THE FA TO PROCEED WITH IMPLEMENTING THE TWO POLICIES.  THE FA MET WITH THE CLIENT TO COMPLETE THE APPLICATIONS AND RELATED PAPERWORK.  EACH FORM WAS EXPLAINED, INFORMATION WAS COMPLETED, AND SIGNATURES WERE OBTAINED AS NEEDED FOR EACH DOCUMENT.  THE CLIENT PROVIDED A VOIDED CHECK TO ACCOMPANY THE ANNUITY APPLICATION TO INTEGRITY LIFE SO THAT THE ANNUAL PAYMENT TO HER COULD BE DIRECT DEPOSITED TO HER ACCOUNT.  SHORTLY AFTER THIS MEETING, THE CLIENT WAS SENT SOME ADDITIONAL FORMS AND SHE INDICATED SHE COULD ADD SOME MONEY TO THE INITIAL PREMIUM SO THAT THE DEATH BENEFIT/ACCELERATED LTC BENEFIT WOULD BE HIGHER.  SHE INCLUDED A CHECK FOR AN ADDITIONAL $10,000 TO BE ADDED WITH THE $20,000 ALREADY IN HER RJ ACCOUNT TO BE USED AS THE FIRST YEAR LIFE INSURANCE PREMIUM.  THE TWO APPLICATIONS WERE SUBMITTED TO THE RESPECTIVE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES.  JOHN HANCOCK STARTED THEIR UNDERWRITING PROCESS TO ACCESS MEDICAL RECORDS AND SCHEDULED MEDICAL EXAMS WITH THE CLIENT.  ON 12/24/08 LINCOLN NATIONAL LIFE (PARENT COMPANY FOR THE AMERICAN LEGACY VARIABLE ANNUITY) SENT THE CLIENT A CONFIRMATION STATEMENT SHOWING HER BALANCE BEING SENT SPECIFICALLY TO INTEGRITY LIFE (NOT JOHN HANCOCK).  NO CONTACT WAS INITIATED BY THE CLIENT TO THE FA CONCERNING THIS STATEMENT.  AS STATED IN THE CLIENT'S COMPLAINT, SHE IS IN GOOD HEALTH SO, THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THE FA OR THE CLIENT TO BELIEVE JOHN HANCOCK WOULD DENY THE LTC RIDER FOR THE LIFE INSURANCE POLICY.  THE UNDERWRITING PROCESS DRAGGED ON FOR VARIOUS REASONS.  DURING THIS SEVERAL MONTH TIME SPAN THE CLIENT AND FA HAD PHONE DISCUSSIONS AS TO WHY THE UNDERWRITING PROCESS WAS TAKING SO LONG.  SHE WAS TOLD THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY WAS BEING SO THOROUGH SINCE THEY MAY HAVE TO PAY OUT OVER $300,000 IN DEATH BENEFIT ON A 79 YEAR OLD WHILE ONLY RECEIVING $30,000 IN THE FIRST YEAR.  SUBSEQUENT YEARS THE PREMIUM ON THE LIFE POLICY FROM JOHN HANCOCK WAS TO BE $19,400, THE AMOUNT PAID OUT BY THE INTEGRITY LIFE IMMEDIATE ANNUITY.  DURING THIS LONG UNDERWRITING PROCESS THE TRANSFER OUT OF HER VARIABLE ANNUITY TO THE IMMEDIATE ANNUITY WAS NEVER BROUGHT UP BY THE CLIENT.  A FIXED ANNUITY WAS NEVER MENTIONED FROM OUR INITIAL MEETING IN 10/2008 UNTIL WE MET IN LATE AUGUST 2009 AFTER SHE WAS DENIED THE LTC RIDER ON THE LIFE INSURANCE POLICY FROM JOHN HANCOCK.  THE FA DID NOT REALIZE THE ANNUITY CONTRACT WAS NOT DELIVERED TO THE CLIENT UNTIL IT WAS FOUND IN HER FILE WHILE LOOKING FOR OTHER PAPERWORK. ONCE IT WAS FOUND, IT WAS DELIVERED.""
