  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC ADMIN RELEASE 33-9800, 34-75099, IA RELEASE 40-4101, INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 RELEASE 31658, JUNE 3, 2015:  THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\""COMMISSION\"") DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 8A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (\""SECURITIES ACT\""), SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (\""EXCHANGE ACT\""), SECTIONS 203(F) AND 203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 (\""ADVISERS ACT\""), AND SECTION 9(B) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 (\""INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT\"") AGAINST TODD M. SCHOENBERGER (\""SCHOENBERGER\"" OR \""RESPONDENT\"").  SCHOENBERGER USED MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS OF MATERIAL FACT TO SOLICIT AT LEAST A DOZEN INVESTORS TO INVEST MONEY IN SHORT-TERM PROMISSORY NOTES ISSUED BY AN UNREGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISER CONTROLLED BY SCHOENBERGER. SCHOENBERGER TOLD PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS THAT THE PROCEEDS OF THE PROMISSORY NOTES WOULD BE USED FOR THE INVESTMENT ADVISER'S WORKING CAPITAL, AND FURTHER CLAIMED THAT THE INVESTMENT ADVISER WOULD REPAY THE PROMISSORY NOTES FROM MANAGEMENT FEES THAT THE INVESTMENT ADVISER WOULD EARN FROM MANAGING A PRIVATE FUND THAT SCHOENBERGER WOULD SHORTLY LAUNCH. SCHOENBERGER FURTHER TOLD INVESTORS THAT A PROMINENT INVESTMENT BANK (HEREAFTER, \""INVESTMENT BANK A\""), AS WELL AS OTHER ACCREDITED INVESTORS, HAD MADE FIRM COMMITMENTS TO INVEST AS MUCH AS $65 MILLION IN THE ONSHORE FUND AND THAT, AS A RESULT, THE INVESTMENT ADVISER'S MANAGEMENT FEES WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL.  BASED ON SCHOENBERGER'S CLAIMS, FOUR INDIVIDUALS INVESTED A TOTAL OF $130,000 IN FOUR PROMISSORY NOTES THAT PROVIDED BETWEEN 3% AND 20% SIMPLE INTEREST. TWO OF THE PROMISSORY NOTES ALSO GAVE INVESTORS 0.5% OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE THAT THE INVESTMENT ADVISER EXPECTED TO EARN FROM MANAGING THE ONSHORE FUND.  SCHOENBERGER'S CLAIMS WERE FALSE. THERE WERE NEVER FIRM COMMITMENTS BY AN INVESTMENT BANK OR ANY ACCREDITED INVESTORS TO INVEST IN THE ONSHORE FUND. MOREOVER, SCHOENBERGER DIVERTED MORE THAN HALF OF INVESTOR FUNDS HE RECEIVED-AT LEAST $67,000-FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL USE, INCLUDING FOR USE AS A DOWN PAYMENT ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW HOME AND TO PAY LIVING EXPENSES. THE ONSHORE FUND NEVER LAUNCHED AND NO INVESTOR RECEIVED THE RETURNS PROMISED BY SCHOENBERGER.  AS A RESULT OF HIS CONDUCT, SCHOENBERGER'S WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTIONS 5(A), 5(C), AND 17(A) OF THE SECURITIES ACT, SECTION 10(B) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND RULE 10B-5 THEREUNDER, AND SECTION 206(4) OF THE ADVISERS ACT AND RULE 206(4)-8 PROMULGATED THEREUNDER."",
