  ""Broker Comment"" : ""My take home pay for 2019 was $30k.  My partner has been unable to find work for over 2 years now, and I have been the sole income providing for our family of 4.  My daughter had significant medical bills in September 2019 which initially caused me to fall behind on my monthly credit card payments.  In January & February 2020 I had multiple medical procedures as well which affected my ability to work and bring in income.  By the time I recovered financially and was in a position to begin payments again, it was too late and the accounts was charged-off.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I had written a check to Walmart for $170.78 in January 1995.  Apparently I did not have enough funds in the account at the time the check cleared, and it was returned NSF.  The bank account documents were all directed to the apartment that I was living in at the time, so an unfortunate set of circumstances occurred.  Shortly after writing the check, I moved and did not receive the bank NSF notice.  Shortly thereafter, I went to the bank and closed the account.  I did not realize that the check had not cleared when I closed the account.  Because I moved several more times, I did not receive any further notice in regards to this outstanding check.  Even after the check was filed for record with Randall County in December 1995, I had no idea that this item was outstanding or that a warrant had been issued.  It was not until I married in 1997 and went to the DPS office to change my name that I discovered I had a warrant and I was arrested on the spot.  Immediately after my arrest, I posted my bond and attended my court hearing.  I pled guilty, and I guess that count 1 (theft/ck O/20 U/500) was dismissed because though it was entered on the complaint documents it does not appear in the final judgment.  I paid the check amount, and all fines and penalties to the court.  When I applied for my insurance license in 2015, I disclosed all of this information and provided documentation to the State of Texas.  Unfortunately, I misinterpreted the U4 statement and thought the misdemeanor disclosure applied only to investment related issues, not realizing that my misdemeanor was considered fraud.  I had disclosed everything to my Farmers district manager throughout my entire process.""
