  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I SUED CFG AND ITS PRESIDENT, ELDON OLDRE FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, VIOLATIONS OF ERISA, AND FRAUD. CFG COUNTER-SUED ME FOR VIOLATION OF A NON-COMPETE AND FILED A MOTION FOR A TEMPORARY INJUNCTION TO PREVENT ME FROM CONTINUING TO DO BUSINESS WITH MY CLIENTS. THE COURT REDUCED THE NON-COMPETE TO ONE YEAR AND ISSUED A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER FOR THE BALANCE OF THE ONE YEAR PERIOD. AT TRIAL THE COURT DISMISSED MY BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM BASED ON THEIR INTERPRETATION OF A STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. RATHER THATN APPEAL, I DROPPED MY ERISA AND FRAUD CLAIM IN RETURN FOR CFG DROPPING THEIR COUNTER CLAIM.""
