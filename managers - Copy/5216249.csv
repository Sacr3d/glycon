  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Registered rep was gifted a car on 10/28/2012 and the State of PA charged sales tax.  The charge was disputed, a hearing took place on 1/24/2014 where gift paperwork was provided and the registered rep thought that the sales tax was no longer owed.  In Oct. 2018, the registered rep started with HFD where Compliance ran a background check reflecting a lien with the State of PA (sales tax from 2015).  Rep is currently disputing this charge.""
