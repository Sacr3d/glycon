  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Admin Release 34-88724; Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release 4129, April 22, 2020: The Securities and Exchange Commission (\""Commission\"") deems it appropriate that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\""Exchange Act\""), against Brian M. Storms (\""Storms\"" or \""Respondent\""). The Commission finds that these proceedings involve Liquid Holdings Group, Inc.'s (\""Liquid\"") materially misleading disclosures in its periodic filings regarding the nature and growth of its customer base and its reliance on its largest customer, QuantX Management LLP (\""QuantX\""). During the third quarter of 2013 through the second quarter of 2014, Liquid represented that its ability to expand its customer base was an indicator of the growth of its business. Liquid also stated in its Form 10-K for 2013 and its quarterly filings for the first and second quarters of 2014 that QuantX, its largest customer and a related party, and Liquid's affiliated customers, accounted for a small percentage of its customers. During the relevant period, however, Liquid's customer base consisted almost entirely of customers that were referred to Liquid by QuantX and provided with trading capital by QuantX (the \""QuantX Traders\""). Liquid did not disclose in its periodic filings that virtually all of its customers were QuantX Traders. Liquid's largest shareholder (\""Shareholder A\"") loaned millions to QuantX to enable it to pay its software subscription fees to Liquid for the second quarter of 2014. Liquid's Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2014 stated that QuantX represented 63 percent of Liquid's software revenue for that quarter but failed to disclose that Liquid was reliant on Shareholder A to provide QuantX with the money to pay its software subscription fees to Liquid that quarter. Storms, Liquid's CEO, reviewed the SEC filings described above, and signed and/or certified them. As a result of the conduct described herein, Storms was a cause of Liquid's violations of the reporting provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, and 12b-20 promulgated thereunder."",
