OUR RECORDS REFLECT THE CLIENT SIGNED A SELF DIRECTED IRA - BENEFICIARY ELECTION PAYOUT FORM FOR EACH OF THE ACCOUNTS ON JULY 23, 2009. THESE FORMS ALSO INDICATED THAT THE FIRM RECOMMENDS THE CLIENT SEEK THE ADVICE OF A TAX PROFESSIONAL PRIOR TO SIGNING THE FORM(S). ACCORDING TO OUR RECORDS, ASSETS WERE TRANSFERRED FROM THE RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS TO THE CLIENT'S SINGLE REGISTRATION ACCOUNT ON JULY 29, 2009. THE FA HAS INDICATED PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE OF THE ANNUITY HE AND THE CLIENT DISCUSSED THE CLIENT'S INVESTMENT NEEDS, GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AS WELL AS THE TAX DEFERRAL ADVANTAGE THAT THE ANNUITY WOULD PROVIDE. OUR RECORDS REFLECT A JOHN HANCOCK VENTURE OPPORTUNITY VARIABLE ANNUITY WAS PURCHASED ON AUGUST 3, 2009. BASED ON OUR REVIEW, IT SEEMS THE CLIENT WAS ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH A TAX PROFESSIONAL ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. IN ADDITION, THE FUNDS WERE TRANSFERRED FROM THE IRA ACCOUNTS BASED ON INSTRUCTIONS RECEIVED IN SIGNED BENEFICIARY ELECTION PAYOUT FORMS. FURTHER, THE FUNDS HELD IN THE IRA ACCOUNTS WOULD HAVE EVENTUALLY BEEN REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNT WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A TAX LIABILITY TO THE RECIPIENT. IN REVIEWING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, IT APPEARS THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING OR MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CLIENT AND THE FA. THEREFORE, WE ARE EXTENDING AN OFFER TO THE CLIENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $2,000.00 WHICH REPRESENTS A PORTION OF THE TAX LIABILITY INCURRED. CLIENT HAS THIRTY DAYS IN WHICH TO ACCEPT OUR OFFER. CLIENT DID NOT ACCEPT OUR OFFER; THEREFORE, IT HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""OUR RECORDS REFLECT YOU PURCHASED 1670 SHARES ON JULY 22, 2008; YOU PREVIOUSLY OWNED 750 SHARES WHICH WERE SOLD ON NOVEMBER 6, 2007.  ACCORDING TO THE FA, WHEN HE WAS REVIEWING YOUR ACCOUNT HE INDICATED THE SHARES OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL HAD DECREASED A GREAT DEAL SINCE YOU LIQUIDATED.  IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING YOU ASKED FOR THE FA WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE SECURITY.  THE FA STATES HE INFORMED YOU EDWARD JONES HAD A SELL RATING ON WASHINGTON MUTUAL.  HE STATES HE ALSO INFORMED YOU THERE WAS DOWNSIDE RISK AND POTENTIAL UPSIDE RISK.  HE STATES HE INFORMED YOU THE DOWNSIDE RISK WAS THE SECURITY COULD GO TO $0.  THE FA STATES HE DID NOT GUARANTEE THE STOCK WOULD GO UP IN VALUE; HE STATES HE INFORMED YOU IT COULD INCREASE IN VALUE BUT DID NOT GUARANTEE IT WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE.  BASED ON OUR REVIEW, IT APPEARS YOU WERE INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PURCHASING THE SHARES OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL.  WHILE WE UNDERSTAND YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTMENT, THE VALUE OF THESE SECURITY IS ATTRIBUTED TO CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND MARKET FLUCTUATION, WHICH IS A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING. IN LIGHT OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE REQUEST OF REIMBURSEMENT IS RESPECTFULLY DENIED.""
