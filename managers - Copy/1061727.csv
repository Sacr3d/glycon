  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC ADMIN RELEASE 34-63323; IA RELEASE 3109, NOVEMBER 17, 2010: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\""COMMISSION\"") DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 15(B) AND 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (\""EXCHANGE ACT\"") AND SECTIONS 203(F) AND 203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 (\""ADVISERS ACT\"") AGAINST LLOYD R. KARP (\""KARP OR \""RESPONDENT\"").  IN ANTICIPATION OF THE INSTITUTION OF THE PROCEEDINGS, RESPONDENT SUBMITTED AN OFFER OF SETTLEMENT (\""OFFER\"") WHICH THE COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED TO ACCEPT.  THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT KARP WAS THE CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER OF A BROKER-DEALER AND A RELATED INVESTMENT ADVISER.  HE HAS ALSO BEEN THE CHIEF OPERATIONS OFFICER OF THE BROKER-DEALER SINCE 2004, AND IS THE CORPORATE SECRETARY, TREASURER AND A SENIOR VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE FIRM.  KARP HAS A SMALL DIRECT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE BROKER-DEALER.  KARP HAS BEEN AN ASSOCIATED PERSON AND REGISTERED PRINCIPAL OF THE BROKER-DEALER SINCE DECEMBER 2002.  THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT THE REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER AND INSTITUTIONAL EQUITY RESEARCH FIRM, AND ITS SUBSIDIARY, A REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISER, FAILED TO ESTABLISH, MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE NATURE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AND INTERCONNECTED BUSINESSES, TO PREVENT THE MISUSE OF MATERIAL, NONPUBLIC INFORMATION.  FOR 2005, THE INVESTMENT ADVISER ALSO FAILED TO CONDUCT AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE ADEQUACY OF ITS COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, AS REQUIRED BY THE ADVISERS ACT.  THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT THE BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISER'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WERE DEFICIENT IN A NUMBER OF WAYS.  THE BROKER-DEALER HAD A WRITTEN PROCEDURE TO ADDRESS THE MISUSE OF MATERIAL, NONPUBLIC INFORMATION, BUT DID NOT FOLLOW ITS WRITTEN PROCEDURE IN PRACTICE. IMPORTANT COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WERE NOT CONTAINED IN THE INVESTMENT ADVISER'S WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. FURTHER, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE INVESTMENT ADVISER'S WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WERE SO UNCLEAR THAT EMPLOYEES DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. IN OTHER INSTANCES, THE PRACTICES THE INVESTMENT ADVISER EMPLOYED VARIED MATERIALLY FROM ITS WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THESE FAILURES LED TO INADEQUATE IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE FIRMS' WRITTEN COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.  THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT THE INVESTMENT ADVISER ALSO FAILED TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN RECORDS EVIDENCING IMPORTANT SUPERVISORY AUTHORIZATIONS AND COMPLIANCE REVIEWS.  IN OCTOBER 2006, THE COMMISSION EXAMINATION STAFF BEGAN CONDUCTING AN EXAMINATION OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISER. IN THE COURSE OF PREPARING FOR THE EXAMINATION AND COLLECTING RECORDS TO PRODUCE TO THE COMMISSION STAFF, THE INVESTMENT ADVISER DISCOVERED THAT CERTAIN COMPLIANCE-RELATED RECORDS WERE INCOMPLETE AND THAT OTHERS WERE MISSING FROM ITS FILES.  THE INVESTMENT ADVISER PERSONNEL ALTERED ITS RECORDS BY CREATING COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTS, AND PRODUCED THOSE RECORDS TO THE COMMISSION EXAMINATION STAFF WITHOUT DISCLOSING THAT THOSE RECORDS INCLUDED \""REPLACEMENTS\"" FOR INCOMPLETE OR MISSING RECORDS.  THIS CONDUCT PREVENTED THE EXAMINATION STAFF FROM DISCOVERING THE INVESTMENT ADVISER'S FAILURE TO FOLLOW ITS COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES AND VIOLATED THE INVESTMENT ADVISER'S STATUTORY OBLIGATION TO MAKE ITS RECORDS AVAILABLE FOR EXAMINATION.  THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT KARP WAS THE CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER OF BOTH THE BROKER-DEALER AND THE INVESTMENT ADVISER DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD AND WAS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND ADMINISTERING THE FIRMS' COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT MISUSE OF MATERIAL, NONPUBLIC INFORMATION. KARP FAILED TO DISCHARGE THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES ADEQUATELY, WHICH RESULTED IN THE VIOLATIONS BY THE BROKER-DEALER AND THE INVESTMENT ADVISER."",
