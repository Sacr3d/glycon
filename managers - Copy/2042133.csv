  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN OCTOBER 2006 I SHARED THE INCOME LOCK PRODUCT WITH [SPOUSE] AND [CUSTOMER].  I EXPRESSED TO THEM THAT IF WITHDRAWS STARTED AGE 65 OR LATER THE MAWA WOULD BE FOR LIFE OR AT LEAST 20 YEARS.  I DID EXPRESS TO THEM THAT THIS WOULD CARRY OVER TO A SPOUSAL BENEFICIARY AS WELL.  THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME BY THE COMPANY.   LATER I FOUND OUT THAT THE LIFETIME BENEFIT TO SPOUSE WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN A TSA BUT WAS IN AN IRA. SO IN JUNE 2009 I MET WITH THE [CUSTOMER'S] AND SHARED THIS INFO WITH THEM.  WE TALKED ABOUT MOVING MONEY FROM THE TSA TO THE IRA TO GET SURVIVOR LIFETIME BENEFIT, HOWEVER DUE TO A DOWNTURN IN THE MARKET, THE BENEFIT BALANCE IN THE IRA WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER.  THE 06-30-2009 BALANCE WAS 163,432.41.  THERE MAWA WOULD HAVE BEEN  $8171.61 VS $13,629.83.  THE CHOICE THE [CUSTOMER'S] THOUGHT THEY HAD HERE WAS EITHER A) RECEIVE THE LOWER AMOUNT THRU BOTH OF THERE LIVES, OR B) RECEIVE THE LARGER AMOUNT THRU OWNER'S LIFE OR 20 YEARS, WHICHEVER IS LONGER.  THEY CHOOSE B.  IN SUMMARY, I PRESENTED TO THE [CUSTOMER'S] THE INCOME LOCK PRODUCT AS IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME, AND IN MY LAST PRESENTATION TO THEM, I EXPRESSED THEY COULD EXPECT $13629.83 ANNUAL FOR STAN'S LIFE WITH A MINIMUM PAYOUT OF 20 YEARS""
