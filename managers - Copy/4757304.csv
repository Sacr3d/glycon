  ""Broker Comment"" : ""AS A RESULT OF OUR INVESTIGATION, WE HAVE MADE THE DECISION TO EXTEND A SETTLEMENT OFFER TO THE CLIENT IN THE AMOUNT OF 5604.00. THE SETTLEMENT REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF TAX INCREASE THE CLIENT INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE SURRENDER OF THE LINCOLN ANNUITY. AT THE TIME THE ANNUITY WAS SURRENDERED IN APRIL 2009, THE PROCEEDS WERE DEPOSITED INTO A SINGLE REGISTRATION ACCOUNT WITH EDWARD JONES AND NOT A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT.  ON OR AROUND JANUARY 2010, CLIENT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN RECEIPT OF DISTRIBUTIONS. CLIENT WOULD HAVE ALSO BEEN IN RECEIPT OF A 1099-R FROM LINCOLN NATIONAL, WHICH REFLECTED THE GROSS DISTRIBUTION FROM ER RETIREMENT ANNUITY WITH A DISTRIBUTION CODE OF 7 (NORMAL DISTRIBUTION). IF CLIENT WOULD HAVE CONTACTED OUR FIRM IN EARLY 2010, WE COULD HAVE INFORMED HER THE TAX REPORTING WAS ACCURATE AND A 5498 WOULD NOT BE PRODUCED AS NO ROLLOVER OCCURRED. IN REGARD TO THE PENALTY AND INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCORRECT FILING OF YOUR 2009 TAX RETURN, IT APPEARS CLIENT NEEDS TO WORK WITH HER ACCOUNTANT TO DETERMINE WHY THERE WERE INACCURACIES IN HER 2009 TAX RETURN. WE WILL NOT BE OFFERING ANY COMPENSATION FOR THE PENALTY AND INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCORRECT FILING OF YOUR TAXES. WE B ELIEVE THE OFFER TO BE MORE THAN FAIR, AS CLIENT ULTIMATELY WOULD HAVE HAD TO PAY TAXES (AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE) ON ANY AND ALL DISTRIBUTIONS FROM HER RETIREMENT ACCOUNT. 10/13/2011 RECEIVED SIGNED SETTLEMENT OF CLAIM FROM CLIENT.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CLIENT PURCHASED A VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT PROVIDING A 5% ANNUAL STEP UP, OR THE ACCOUNT VALUE, WHICHEVER IS HIGHER FOR INCOME WITHDRAWAL PURPOSES, AND A GUARANTEED 5% INCOME WITHDRAWAL FOR LIFE, EVEN IF THE PRINCIPAL WERE TO GO TO ZERO. THE CLIENT NOTED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT LETTER HE SIGNED 11/13/07, HE WAS PURCHASING THE ANNUITY FOR THE GUARANTEED INCOME BENEFITS. THE LETTER FURTHER STATES \""I AM AWARE THE PERFORMANCE OF MY ANNUITY IS NOT GUARANTEED BY THE ISSUING COMPANY OR EDWARD JONES AND THE VALUE OF MY ORIGINAL INVESTMENT MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE AT ANY GIVEN TIME. I UNDERSTAND VARIABLE ANNUITIES ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET FLUCTUATION.\"" THE CLIENT SIGNED THE DELIVERY RECEIPT WHEN HE RECEIVED THE ANNUITY CONTRACT. THE DELIVERY RECEIPT STATES THE CONTRACT IS A VARIABLE ANNUITY CLASS A CONTRACT. OUR RECORDS ALSO INDICATE THE CLIENT RECEIVED A PROSPECTUS FOR THE VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT. OUR INVESTIGATION ALSO REVEALED THE CLIENT HAS BEEN SENT QUARTERLY STATEMENTS FROM SUNAMERICA, WHICH REFLECT THE CONTRACT IS A VARIABLE CONTRACT AND HOW THE FUNDS ARE INVESTED. OUR RECORDS INDICATE THE CLIENT HAS BEEN SENT MONTHLY STATEMENTS FROM EDWARD JONES REFLECTING THE ANNUITY AND THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE SINCE IT WAS PURCHASED IN 2007. BASED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT LETTER THE CLIENT SIGNED AND THE DISCUSSIONS HE HAD WITH THE FA WE BELIEVE THE VARIABLE ANNUITY WAS PURCHASED WITH THE CLIENTS FULL UNDERSTANDING AND KNOWLEDGE. WE ALSO BELIEVE HAD YOU NOT BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH THE PURCHASE, HE WOULD HAVE EXERCISED THE FREE LOOK, WHICH HE DID NOT DO. IN REGARDS TO THE PENALTIES RELATED TO TAKING WITHDRAWALS BEFORE AGE 59, IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THIS WAS EXPLAINED TO THE CLIENT DURING THE DISCUSSIONS HE HAD WITH THE FA. IN LIGHT OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE WE RESPECTFULLY DENY ANY REQUEST FOR REIMBURSEMENT RELATED TO THIS INVESTMENT.""
