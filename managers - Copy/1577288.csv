  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 19813, AUGUST 28, 2006: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\""COMMISSION\"") ANNOUNCED A CIVIL FRAUD ACTION AGAINST JASON GINDER, A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE FORMERLY EMPLOYED BY A BROKER-DEALER, IN CONNECTION WITH HIS MARKET TIMING TRADES IN NUMEROUS MUTUAL FUNDS.  THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT GINDER VIOLATED SECTION 17(A) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (\""SECURITIES ACT\"") AND SECTION 10(B) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (\""EXCHANGE ACT\"") AND RULE 10B-5 THEREUNDER.  THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT, FROM AT LEAST 2001 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2003, GINDER DEFRAUDED MORE DOZENS OF MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES AND THEIR SHAREHOLDERS IN THOUSANDS OF MARKET TIMING TRADES WORTH MORE THAN $2.5 BILLION.  GINDER ACCOMPLISHED THE FRAUD BY MISREPRESENTING HIS IDENTITY AND THE IDENTITIES OF HIS HEDGE FUND CUSTOMERS.   GINDER KNEW THAT CERTAIN MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES MONITORED ACTIVITY IN HIS FUNDS FOR EXCESSIVE TRADING.  TO MAKE THEIR MARKET TIMING HARDER TO DETECT, GINDER OPENED MORE THAN 750 ACCOUNTS FOR WHAT WERE, IN REALITY, ONLY A HANDFUL OF CUSTOMERS, AND SUBMITTED TRADES USING DOZENS OF BROKER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS.  WHEN A FUND COMPANY MANAGED TO IDENTIFY CERTAIN ACCOUNTS AND BROKER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS AS ENGAGED IN MARKET TIMING, GINDER USED ACCOUNTS AND NUMBERS THAT HAD NOT YET BEEN BLOCKED TO EVADE THE RESTRICTIONS AND CONTINUE TRADING.  GINDER'S USE OF MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS AND BROKER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS CONCEALED HIS AND HIS CUSTOMERS' IDENTITIES AND THUS MISLED THE FUND COMPANIES INTO PROCESSING TRADES FROM BROKERS AND CUSTOMERS WHOSE BUSINESS THEY WANTED TO REJECT."",
