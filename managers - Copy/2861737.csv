  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The problem started in 2008 when my income as managing general agent w/ American National started to decline because of their financial issues. They Increased P&C rates to the point that we received over 50% cancellations due to stricter u.w. rules as well as the reduction of commissions to my agents. Forcing them to leave and leaving me with no income to support my offices and staff. Plus, they sold their securities firm SMR which caused even more problems for the agents. I've been trying to recuperate from these losses and get back on y feet as a securities representative.""
