I HAD [CUSTOMER] SIGN EVERY FORM, SOME OF THEM MULTIPLE TIMES, AS I MADE SEVERAL TRIPS TO HER HOME DURING THE PROCESS.  THE LAST TIME, SHE WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE ON A TRIP.  HER HUSBAND TOOK THE FORMS TO HER FOR HER SIGNATURE, THEN RETURNED THEM TO ME.  SHE ORIGINALLY WORKED WITH EX-VALIC ADVISOR [THIRD PARTY], WHO HAD ROLLED HER MONEY OUT OF VALIC.  AFTERWARDS, [CUSTOMER] DECIDED SHE WANTED HER MONEY BACK WITH VALIC FOR THE FIXED ACCOUNT SECURITY.""
