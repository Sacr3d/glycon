  ""Broker Comment"" : ""PAYMENT OF 18,519 BY E + O.  I PAID $2,500 DEDUCTIBLE. [CUSTOMER] CAME TO ME TO INVEST MONEY. NEEDED ACCOUNT TO HELP SUPPLEMENT HIS RETIREMENT INCOME. INVESTED IN BOND FUND OF AMERICA.  SIX MONTHS LATER WHILE PREPARING TAX RETURNS, CLIENT RECEIVED A 1099-R.  HE APPROACHED ME AND INDICATED PROCEEDS WERE TO BE INVESTED AS AN IRA ROLLOVER. I INVESTED HIM IN A NON-QUALIFYING ACCT.  THIS RESULTED IN A TAX LIABILITY FOR THE CLIENT.  HE MADE A COMPLAINT.  WE FILED A CLAIM WITH MY E + O COVERAGE. - AFTER REVIEW THEY PAID THE CLIENT IN FULL.  AMOUNT PAID WAS BASED ON THE CLIENT'S TAX LIABILITY - IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING FROM MY NOTES, AND CUSTOMER ACCOUNT CARD, THAT THE MONEY WAS TO BE INVESTED IN A NON-QUALIFIED ACCOUNT. - BUT HE WAS NOT IN GOOD HEALTH AT THE TIME, BUT CLAIMS HE INFORMED ME OF THE IRA ROLLOVER.""
