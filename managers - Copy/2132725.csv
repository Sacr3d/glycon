  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS MATTER INVOLVED A COMPLEX STRATEGY RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN TENANT IN COMMON PROPERTIES. THE INVESTMENT PRODUCT AND THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY WERE ENTIRELY SUITABLE, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE SUBSEQUENT UNIQUE AND UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE'S CONTROL, SUCH AS THE CUSTOMER'S CHOICE TO CHANGE ITS CORPORATE BUSINESS STRUCTURE AND THE DEATH OF THE FOUNDER. THE STRATEGY RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT TAX SAVINGS AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN REALIZED HAD THE STRATEGY NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. IN FACT THE FAMILY RETAINED  MORE THAN $1 MILLION THAT THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE PARTED WITH.  NONETHELESS, THE MATTER WAS SETTLED AT MEDIATION BECAUSE IT WAS LESS COSTLY THAN PROCEEDING TO A FULL ADJUDICATION ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE.""

IN FACT, PRIOR TO THE CLIENT'S SECOND DIVORCE,  I WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH HER ATTORNEY TO SECURE AN ADDITIONAL $2,000,000 IN DIVORCE PROCEEDS, AND CREATED A FINANCIAL PLAN THAT (HAD IT BEEN ADHERED TO) WOULD HAVE PROVIDED SUSTAINABLE MONTHLY INCOME. DESPITE THIS, THE CLIENT CHOSE TO LIVE WELL BEYOND HER MEANS, CONTINUALLY FAILING TO HEAD MY ADVICE TO RATCHET BACK HER SPENDING AND LIFESTYLE. RATHER THAN ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HER CHOICES, SHE CHOSE TO AUGMENT HER INCOME BY FILING SUITS AGAINST THE MANY PROFESSIONALS THAT LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HER FINANCIAL SECURITY.""
