  ""Broker Comment"" : ""On April 6th the client sent an initial email; however, it was not a definitive order to sell. The client discussed the liquidation strategy with the Advisor over the next 3 days through email and phone calls. Sales took place as agreed on April 9th. Email and phone logs reflect this. For the time period in question, April 6-April 30, 2020 documentation shows that the account gained $64,389. Therefore, the request for reimbursement which alleged that there was a $46,322.63 loss, has no merit.""
