  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Ms Mclean was a referral. She requested an appointment to move her portfolio from an alternate broker and wanted to invest more money she had in savings.  We went thru the profiling process and reviewed her holdings of $700,000 in stocks , mutual funds, and two annuities out of surrender. She had the portfolio long enough for annuities to be out of surrender but did not want to look at options for them.  I had suggested an annuity care product which had a long term care rider. This was because she could use the product for tax deferral and LTC, which she said that money was earmarked for. We looked at an illustration. We also discussed her portfolio which was moderate aggressive. $200,000 in aggressive stocks, and mutual  funds. It had been thru down markets in the past but ,she did not want to reallocate as she said she was not concerned about volatility. She had strong feelings about the market, so I suggested she leave it there in the managed portfolio and suggested we look at more conservative alternative in several Franklin funds, with a long term history and stable share price in previous markets. She took the materials and said she had discussed with her nephew at Merril Lynch, before we invested. The Franklin would be liquid should she need it, as well as her two annuities , and her savings. She had ample income and minimal expenses.. She came back to invest in January and even added in May and July, money I did not know she had. However no one could have predicted the 2000 pt market drop and she would not leave it to recover,  although I had strongly encouraged her to. I had spent alot of time with her in a short period, 15 meetings, whenever she requested and had shared monthly commentaries from Franklin with her. We reviewed her portfolio at the other broker as well.. She was not misled. She is a savvy investor who knew the market , the risks, and that this investment was  not FDIC insured. It was her intention for an investment , not an annuity or longterm care product or anymore stocks, to compliment her other investments which is why this recommendation was made.""
