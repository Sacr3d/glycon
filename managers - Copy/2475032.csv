BY MY CALCULATIONS, CLIENT WAS UP $4,700 WHEN HE LEFT ME.  CLIENT WAS AN AGGRESSIVE, ACTIVE TRADER WHO WANTED TO TRADE FOR SHORT-TERM PROFITS AND WAS INTERESTED IN PENNY STOCKS WHICH HE TRANSFERRED IN TO OLDE. AFTER CLIENT TRANSFERRED FROM ME, MARKET DECLINED AND, I BELIEVE, THE CLIENT EXPERIENCED LOSSES AND THIS LED TO HIS COMPLAINT.""
