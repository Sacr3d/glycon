  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS WAS A PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN I TOOK OUT WHEN I WAS IN UNDERGRAD.  I GRADUATED IN THE SUMMER OF 2007 AND BY THE FALL OF 2008 IT BECAME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO PROCURE A JOB THAT ALLOWED ME TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON MY LOANS WHICH HAD SINCE ENDED THEIR FORBEARANCE PERIOD.  I MAINTAINED ON-TIME PAYMENTS ON MY FEDERAL DEBT BUT COULD NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF MY PRIVATE DEBIT AND DEFAULTED IN JANUARY OF 2009.  I MADE MONTHLY PAYMENTS (OF $300/MONTH) TO A RECOVERY AGENCY FROM 2010 TO 2014 TO HELP SATISFY THIS DEBT AND IN OCTOBER THEY OFFERED ME A LUMP-SUM COMPROMISE TO SATISFY THE DEBT, WHICH I ACCEPTED.""
