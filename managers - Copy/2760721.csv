ON JANUARY 22, 2009, THE OFFICE RECEIVED A COPY OF THE DOCUMENT IN THE MAIL AND THE RA'S NOTARY SEAL WAS AFFIXED TO THE DOCUMENT WITH HER FORGED SIGNATURE.

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE RR ADMITS TO SIGNING HIS ASSISTANT'S NAME, AN ACTION HE DEEPLY REGRETS.  HE ONLY WISHED TO FACILITATE THE NEEDS AND WISHES OF HIS CLIENT AND DID NOT STAND TO BE FINANCIALLY ENRICHED IN DOING SO.  HOWEVER, TWO FACTS ARE CURRENTLY IN DISPUTE.  IT WAS STATED ON THE U-5 THAT THE RR ASKED HIS ASSISTANT TO NOTARIZE THE DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION THE WEEK OF JANUARY 12, 2009.  THE RR'S NOTES INDICATE HE RECEIVED THE PAPERWORK FROM THE CLIENT ON ABOUT JANUARY 19TH, ONE WEEK LATER.  THE U-5 ALSO STATES THE RR \""...ADMITTED TO FORGING THE NOTARY'S NAME AND AFFIXING THE SEAL.\""  THIS STATEMENT CONTRASTS THE STATEMENT ON THE EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION REPORT SIGNED BY THE RR'S SUPERVISOR WHICH READS \""(RR) ADMITTED TO FORGING (RA) SIGNATURE ON HER NOTARY SEAL ON A DOCUMENT DATED JANUARY 15, 2009.\""  IN ADDITION, IT WAS THE RA'S RESPONSIBILITY TO SECURE HER SEAL PER COMPANY POLICY AND AT NO TIME DID THE RR HAVE ACCESS TO THE NOTARY SEAL, OR EVEN HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF, WHERE THE RA'S NOTARY SEAL WAS KEPT.""
