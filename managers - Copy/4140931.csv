  ""Firm Name"" : ""LINCOLN FINANCIAL DISTRIBUTORS, INC."",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""FIRM TERMINATED WHOLESALER AFTER INTERNAL INVESTIGATION & INTERVIEW WITH WHOLESALER CONCERNING QUESTIONABLE REPORTING OF SALES ACTIVITIES ON THE FIRM'S TRACKING SYSTEM."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""WHILE I WAS EMPLOYED WITH LINCOLN FINANCIAL GROUP I WAS PLACED ON A DOCUMENTED PERFORMANCE REVIEW. I WAS NOTIFIED ON JANUARY 6, 2013 THAT BECAUSE MY SALES AND ACTIVITY LEVELS WERE TOO LOW THAT I WOULD NEED TO IMPROVE THEM WITHIN 60 DAYS TO AVOID FURTHER DISCIPLINARY ACTION.  I RECEIVED AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN ON JANUARY 15, 2013.  A FEW DAYS LATER ON JANUARY 18, 2013 I RECEIVED A CALL FROM MY MANAGER MICHAEL FOX.  MICHAEL HAD CALLED ME BECAUSE HE WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MY LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN MY TERRITORY.  DURING THE CONVERSATION MICHAEL HAD POINTED OUT THAT HE HAD REVIEWED MY CALENDAR AND HIS CONCERN WAS THAT THE NUMBER OF APPOINTMENTS ON THE CALENDAR DID NOT MATCH THE NUMBER OF APPOINTMENTS I HAD ENTERED INTO SALESFORCE, THE CLIENT RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  MICHAEL WENT THROUGH EACH WEEK BEGINNING FROM MY START DATE IN MAY 2012 AND COUNTED THE NUMBER OF MEETINGS I HAD ENTERED IN THE CALENDAR WEEK BY WEEK.  MICHAEL CONTINUOUSLY EXPLAINED THAT THE SHORTAGE OF MEETINGS WAS A SERIOUS ISSUE BECAUSE I HAD BEEN PLACED ON A PERFORMANCE REVIEW FOR MY SALES AND ACTIVITY LEVELS A FEW DAYS PRIOR TO THIS CONVERSATION.  I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO MICHAEL SEVERAL TIMES THAT I WAS NOT KEEPING MY CALENDAR UP TO DATE WITH THE MEETINGS I WAS HAVING BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THAT WAS THE PROCESS OF TRACKING MY APPOINTMENTS.  ADDITIONALLY, I EXPLAINED TO MICHAEL THAT I NEVER RECEIVED TRAINING ON HOW TO EXACTLY ENTER MEETINGS INTO SALESFORCE.  DURING MY WHOLESALING CAREER I HAVE NEVER USED THE SYSTEM AND HAD TO FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF.  MY ACTIVITY NUMBERS HAD MATCHED THE MEETINGS I WAS HAVING SO TO THIS POINT I HAD DID NOT HAVE ANY INDICATION THAT I WAS ENTERING MY MEETINGS INCORRECTLY ONLY THAT MICHAEL HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE NUMBER OF MEETINGS I WAS HAVING.  MICHAEL'S RESPONSE TO THIS WAS THAT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF ME AND THAT HE WOULD NEED TO NOTIFY HUMAN RESOURCES TO REVIEW THE SITUATION.  ON THURSDAY JANUARY 24, 2013 I RECEIVED ANOTHER PHONE CALL FROM MICHAEL AND A REPRESENTATIVE FROM LINCOLN'S HUMAN RECOURSES DEPARTMENT LEON BARNES.  DURING THIS CALL I WAS NOTIFIED THAT I WAS BEING TERMINATED BECAUSE THE ISSUES DESCRIBED ABOVE.  AT THIS POINT I CHOSE NOT TO CONTEST WHAT THEY WERE SAYING BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT I WAS NOT LONGER WANTED AT LINCOLN.  I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED IN WRITING WHAT THE EXACT REASON FOR MY TERMINATION WAS.  I WAS MADE AWARE OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION ON FEBRUARY 6, 2013 WHEN I RECEIVED A CALL FROM MY MANAGERS AT JOHN HANCOCK EXPLAINING THAT LINCOLN HAD NOTED MY FINRA RECORD.  I'VE REACHED OUT TO LEON BARNES AT LINCOLN REGARDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND MY TERMINATION.  HE NOTIFIED ME THAT I WOULD NOT RECEIVE ANYTHING IN WRITING AND THAT HE WOULD NEED TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION WITH LINCOLN'S COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT.  I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE A RESPONSE FROM HIM.  I DO FEEL THAT MY TERMINATION WAS UNWARRANTED.  I STARTED WITH THEM BACK IN MAY 2012 AND WAS NEVER GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY OR TRAINING NECESSARY TO SUCCEED IN MY TERRITORY.  MY DIVISIONAL MANAGER WAS VERY CLEAR THAT HE DISAGREED AND THAT HE NO LONGER WANTED ME THERE AS AN EMPLOYEE.  IN MY ALMOST 12 YEARS IN THE INDUSTRY I HAVE NEVER ONCE HAD ISSUES REGARDING MY PERFORMANCE.  I'VE ALWAYS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR SHOWING MY WORK THROUGH ACTIVITIES THAT I INPUT ON MY OWN AND HAVE ALWAYS DONE SO HONESTLY.  TO HEAR THIS FROM MY EMPLOYER WAS SHOCKING TO ME AND I HAD PLANNED ON GIVING MY NOTICE BEFORE I WAS TERMINATED.  AS OF FEBRUARY 12, 2013 I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH AN ATTORNEY TO SEE WHAT STEPS ARE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THIS FROM MY FINRA RECORD.""
