  ""Broker Comment"" : ""[CUSTOMER] STOPPED BY MY OFFICE IN JUNE OF 2007 (THE 21ST) AFTER DEPOSITING A LARGE CHECK INTO HIS TRUST ACCOUNT AND WANTED TO SPEAK WITH ME.  HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD RECENTLY SOLD HIS COMPANY AND WOULD BE ROLLING OVER A LARGE SUM OF MONEY IN THE AUGUST TIME FRAME AND WANTED TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE IN OUR FINANCIAL PLANNING DEPARTMENT.  HE WAS INTERESTED IN A COMPLETE FINANCIAL PLAN AND NOT ANY ADVISED OFFERINGS BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO MANAGE HIS OWN ACCOUNTS.  AS I RECALL, YIELD CAME UP IN THE CONVERSATION AND I MENTIONED THAT YIELD PLUS WAS YIELDING MORE THAN THE MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  IF I HAD ANY IDEA OF WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN I WOULD NEVER HAVE BROUGHT UP YIELD PLUS.  I WAS LEAVING FOR INDIANAPOLIS AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEONE FROM THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT REACHED [CUSTOMER].  I CALLED AND SPOKE TO [THIRD PARTY] AND GAVE HIM THE DETAILS ON WHAT [CUSTOMER] WAS LOOKING FOR AND IS CELL PHONE NUMBER - WHICH WAS THE NUMBER HE WANTED TO BE CONTACTED ON.  AFTER I RETURNED FOR INDIANAPOLIS, I CALLED AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS WERE PROGRESSING WITH THE PLAN AND I DIDN'T RECEIVE A RETURN CALL.  [CUSTOMER] IS ON THE DNC LIST.  WHEN THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT FINALLY REACHED [CUSTOMER] HE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT HE DID NOT WANT THE FC INVOLVED WITH THE FINANCIAL PLANNING PROCESS.""
