AS OUTLINED IN PREVIOUS DISCLOSURES, THE FIRM CENSURED, FINED, AND SUSPENDED THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR (FA) WITHOUT PAY FOR NINETY (90) DAYS, BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2014. AT THAT TIME IN APRIL 2014, D.A. DAVIDSON & CO. REPORTED THE FINDINGS OF ITS INTERNAL INVESTIGATION TO THE CSI AND FINRA. THE FIRM'S, THE CSI'S AND FINRA'S ACTION ALL AROSE FROM THE FA AFFIXING HER CLIENT'S SIGNATURES OR INITIALS ON CERTAIN FORMS IN ORDER TO PROCESS THE FORMS WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. THE FIRM'S INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT, WHILE HER CONDUCT WAS INAPPROPRIATE AND CONTRARY TO FIRM POLICIES AND VALUES, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY REGULATIONS, IT WAS NOT DONE IN A MANNER CONTRARY TO WHAT THE CLIENT INTENDED TO BE DONE IN THE ACCOUNT. SPECIFICALLY, THE FA SIGNED ONE SECTION OF A QUESTIONNAIRE WHERE THE CLIENT HAD ALREADY SIGNED THE CONTRACT AND THE REQUESTED ASSET ALLOCATION. THIS FORM ALSO PROVIDED FOR A LOWER ANNUAL FEE. IN ADDITION, ANOTHER CLIENT HAD REQUESTED AN INCREASE TO A MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION TO THE CLIENT'S BANK ACCOUNT AND THE FA HAD SIGNED THE DISTRIBUTION FORM. THE INITIALED DOCUMENTS CONFIRMED THE CLIENT'S DESIRED ASSET ALLOCATION WHICH WAS PROPERLY SELECTED, SIGNED AND DATED BY THE CLIENTS ON THE SAME PAGE OF THE FORM WHERE THE INITIALS HAD BEEN MISSED AND ADDED BY THE FA. THE FA ENTERED INTO A CONSENT AGREEMENT AND FINAL ORDER WITH THE CSI, AS DISCLOSED IN PREVIOUS DISCLOSURES RELATING TO THIS SAME CONDUCT THAT RESULTED IN THE FIRM'S SANCTION AND HAS NOW ENTERED INTO AN ACCEPTANCE, WAIVER AND CONSENT WITH FINRA FOR THAT SAME CONDUCT.""

SPECIFICALLY, THE FA SIGNED ONE SECTION OF A QUESTIONNAIRE WHERE THE CLIENT HAD ALREADY SIGNED THE CONTRACT AND THE REQUESTED ALLOCATION. THIS FORM ALSO PROVIDED FOR A LOWER ANNUAL FEE. IN ADDITION, ANOTHER CLIENT HAD REQUESTED AN INCREASE TO A MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION TO THE CLIENT'S BANK ACCOUNT AND THE FA HAD SIGNED THE DISTRIBUTION FORM. THE INITIALED DOCUMENTS CONFIRMED THE CLIENT'S DESIRED ASSET ALLOCATION WHICH WAS PROPERLY SELECTED, SIGNED AND DATED BY THE CLIENTS ON THE SAME PAGE OF THE FORM WHERE THE INITIALS HAD BEEN MISSED AND ADDED BY THE FA.
