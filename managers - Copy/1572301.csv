  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE FIRM, WHEAT FIRST SECURITIES, FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES TO AVOID THE TIME AND EXPENSE OF LITIGATION AND WITHOUT ADMITTING ANY LIABILITY ON THE PART OF THE FIRM, SETTLED IN THE AMOUNT OF $21,637.57. THE CUSTOMER MADE THIS CLAIM SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THAT FACT AND AFTER MY EMPLOYMENT WITH THE FIRM. I DID NOT MAKE ANY MISTAKES WITH THIS ACCOUNT AS [CUSTOMER] AND WHEAT FIRST MANAGER GEOFF GRIFFIN CAN AND WILL VERIFY. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION WERE SET UP PER ADVICE PROVIDED BY WHEAT AND HARTFORD. [CUSTOMER] PARTICIPATED IN ALL CONFERENCE CALLS RELATED TO THE ORIGINAL ADVICE PROVIDED BY WHEAT AND HARTFORD, BECAUSE [CUSTOMER]`S ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND DESIRE TO CONTROL BENEFICIARY BENEFIT WAS UNUSAL, I HAD INVOLVED BOTH WHEAT AND HARTFORD. HARTFORD LATER FOLLOWED UP WITH A LETTER ADVISING CLIENT THAT REQUEST WAS NOT HONORED. CLIENT DID NOT ACT UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS LATER. INSURANCE STATE COMMISSIONER FOUND NO WRONG DOING. TO AVOID CLIENT PUBLIC PROTEST, WHEAT SETTLED.""
