  ""Allegations"" : ""THE CUSTOMER HAD AN APARTMENT COMPLEX THAT HE DESIRED TO SELL VIA A 1031 EXCHANGE IN 2008.  I WAS BROUGHT IN BY ANOTHER ASSOCIATE TO PROVIDE THE SELECTION OF REAL ESTATE OPTIONS FOR USE WITH THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF HIS APARTMENT BUILDING.  THE CUSTOMER USED A 'QUALIFIED INTERMEDIARY' TO HANDLE THE TRANSACTION IN ORDER TO MEET ALL IRS RULES REGARDING 1031 EXCHANGES, AND ACCORDING TO THE QUALIFIED INTERMEDIARY THE TRANSACTION MET ALL REQUIREMENTS AND WAS A BONA-FIDE 1031 EXCHANGE. THE CUSTOMER MADE AN ELECTION TO WITHHOLD A SUM OF CASH FROM THE 1031 EXCHANGE, AND GIVEN THIS 'PARTIAL EXCHANGE' WAS ADVISED REPEATEDLY TO SEEK TAX AND LEGAL COUNSEL TO DETERMINE HIS TAX LIABILITY IN THIS TRANSACTION.  THE CUSTOMER SIGNED DOCUMENTS STATING BOTH THAT HE WAS NOT RELYING ON ME OR MY FIRM FOR TAX OR LEGAL ADVICE (DATED 10/18/2007) AND THAT HE HAD HIS OWN TAX ADVISOR (10/22/2008).   THE CUSTOMER ALLEGATIONS STATE THAT HIS TAX LIABILITY WAS DUE TO FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION AND/OR OTHER FORMS OF PROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE ON THE PART OF THE QUALIFIED INTERMEDIARY, THE CPA AND THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES.  I RESPONDED TO HIS LETTER/COMPLAINT VIA AN ATTORNEY INDICATING THAT HIS CLAIM/ALLEGATIONS FOR DAMAGES WERE WITHOUT MERIT, CITING THE SIGNED DOCUMENTS AND DISCLOSURES THAT I NOR MY FIRM PROVIDE TAX OR LEGAL ADVICE, AND THAT THE TAX LIABILITY WAS DUE SOLELY TO THE CUSTOMER'S DECISION TO WITHHOLD CASH AND EFFECT A PARTIAL 1031 EXCHANGE WITHOUT GETTING PROPER TAX CONSULTATION IN ADVANCE."",
