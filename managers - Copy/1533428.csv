  ""Broker Comment"" : ""DURING THE ARBITRATION HEARING THE CUSTOMER ADMITTED THAT HE HAD TRADED HIS ACCOUNT FULLY AT HIS OWN DISCRETION AND THAT THE CATALYST FOR HIS ACTIVITY WAS BASED ON THE \""[THIRD PARTY] REPORT\"".  [THIRD PARTY] APPEARED ALMOST DAILY ON TELEVISION ON THE \""FINANCIAL NEWS NETWORK\"", THE FORERUNNER OF CNBC.   [THIRD PARTY'S] COMMENTARY WOULD GREATLY INFLUENCE THE VALUE OF THE SECURITY THAT HE REPORTED ON.  THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT HE WOULD TRY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE DRAMTIC PRICE FLUCTUATIONS BY PLACING ORDERS IMMEDIATELY AFTER [THIRD PARTY'S] COMMENTARY.    IT WAS ALSO DISCLOSED THAT THE CUSTOMER PLACED TRADES WITH OTHER REPS IN OUR OFFICE ALMOST AS FREQUENTLY AS HE DID WITH ME.  HE PLACED HIS ORDERS WITH WHOEVER ANSWERED THE PHONE FIRST.  IT WAS FURTHER DISCLOSED THAT THE CUSTOMER'S BIGGEST SINGLE LOSS WAS THE RESULT OF A PURCHASE HE HAD MADE PRIOR TO OPENING HIS ACCOUNT WITH Q&R AND THAT HE HAD TRANSFERRED TO AND SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD AT Q&R.  THIS ACCOUNTED FOR THE DISCREPANCY IN THE DAMAGES HE WAS SEEKING AND THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF THE AWARD.   AS THE CHURNING CHARGES BEGAN TO FALL APART, THE CUSTOMER'S ATTORNEY PURSUED Q&R, NOT ME, FOR VIOLATING THE \""KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER\"" RULE.  THE CUSTOMER'S ATTORNEY PRODUCED A COPY OF THE CUSTOMER'S NEW ACCOUNT APPLICATION.  AT THE TIME THAT THE CUSTOMER HAD OPENED HIS ACCOUNT Q&R HAD NOT PROVIDED ADEQUATE SPACE ON THEIR NEW ACCOUNT APPLICATION TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO FULLY DISCLOSE THEIR NET WORTH, LIQUID NET WORTH, INCOME, DEPENDANTS, SOURCE OF FUNDS, INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND RISK TOLERANCE.    THE CONCLUSSION WAS THAT QUICK & REILLY HAD FAILED TO PROTECT THE CUSTOMER FROM HIMSELF BY ALLOWING HIM TO TRADE, FULLY AT HIS OWN DISCRETION, EXCESSIVELY AND IN A MANNER UNSUITABLE FOR HIS MEANS.  AS A RESULT OF THIS HEARING I PERSONALLY WAS NOT FINED, SUSPENDED NOR SANCTIONED.""
