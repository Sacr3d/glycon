  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Complainant's allegations included poor performance with a focus on the first and second quarters of 2020 following the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. She also alleged breach of fiduciary duty, failure to communicate promptly, and failure to follow instructions. While there were losses in the account (especially in the first quarter of 2020) during certain periods since 2006, the overall returns in the accounts were positive. In addition, the representative was retained by the client to implement a specific style of investment which was a mix of long positions in value stocks and options strategies. The representative had implemented this strategy in the client's accounts since 2006 with no prior complaints regarding the representative's management of the accounts. The client was provided with monthly statements, confirmations and an annual letter updating her on what had been done in her accounts during the most recent calendar year and their performance. With regard to failure to follow instructions, the representative disputes that he was directed not to conduct any more trades. Contrary to the customer, his recollection was that the customer directed him not to initiate any new positions until the accounts were transferred out. Pursuant to his understanding of the instruction, the representative sold shares in Michael's (MIK) based on the declining price of the stock during the COVID related market volatility in March and April of 2020.""
