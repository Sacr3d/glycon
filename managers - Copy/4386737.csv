  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I was notified by the State of VA that I did not file my 2014 tax return with the state.  I moved to VA in 06/2014 and filed a paper return with the state; they advised they did not receive it when I called. I am in the process of refilling the return and have placed an official dispute with the Commonwealth. I also, was notified within the same notification that I have 110.70(included in the above total)for 2015. This is also being disputed.""
