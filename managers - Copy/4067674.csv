At the time of sale, all required disclosures and material product features, risks and fees were properly disclosed by the Representative to the clients both verbally and in writing.  Any misunderstanding on the clients' part was likely based on a miscommunication between the client and Key Investments five years after purchase and not due to a misrepresentation on the part of the Representative.  Additionally, Representative contacted the clients one year after the purchase at which time the clients confirmed their approval of the purchase.""

If investment appreciated that made up CD interest, client would receive interest either yearly or at the end of the term.
