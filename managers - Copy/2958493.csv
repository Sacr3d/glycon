SECOND, GURIN HAS REPRESENTED THAT TRINARC IS PLANNING AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (\""IPO\"") FOR THE AUTUMN OF 2001, HAS RECEIVED A LETTER OF INTENT FROM A FIRM TO UNDERWRITE THE OFFERING, AND HAS SECURED THE INTEREST OF OTHER INVESTMENT BANKS. NEITHER THE FIRM, NOR OTHER INVESTMENT BANKS MENTIONED BY GURIN, HAVE EVEN HEARD OF TRINARC, LET ALONE SIGNED A LETTER OF INTENT TO PARTICIPATE IN AN IPO FOR THE COMPANY. \""MIKE GRIPPO\"" IS ACTUALLY AN UNDERCOVER AGENT OF THE FBI WHO HAS RECORDED EDWARD GURIN'S FRAUDULENT SOLICITATIONS.
