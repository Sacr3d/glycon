I DID NOT SELL ANY OF THE CLIENT'S HOLDINGS WITHOUT THEIR EXPRESS CONSENT.I THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED,FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, ALL THE RISKS AND FEATURES OF A VARIABLE ANUITY WITH THE CLIENTS PRIOR TO THEIR DECISION TO PURCHASE. CLIENT, IS A RETIRED CPA AND A WELL-INFORMED INVESTOR. HE WAS PROACTIVE IN THE ACCOUNT RELATIONSHIP AND FULLY AWARE OF ALL PURCHASES, SALES, STOP-LOSS INSTRUCTIONS, FEES, COSTS, COMMISSIONS, SURRENDER FEES AND TAX CONSEQUENCES. ALL INVESTMENT DECISIONS WERE FULLY VETTED WITH CLIENT AND AUTHORIZED. THE ALLEGED UNAUTHORIZED SALE OF STOCK WAS AS A RESULT OF A STOP-LOSS ORDER DIRECTED BY THE CLIENT. THE ANNUITY AT ISSUE WAS CAREFULLY SELECTED BY THE CLIENT AFTER MONTHS OF REVIEW, COMPARISONS, CONSIDERATION AND FULL DISCLOSURE. THE SPECIFIC ANNUITY WAS SELECTED BY THE CLIENT TO REDUCE RISK AND GUARANTEE INCOME FOR THE LIFE OF THE CLIENT AND THEN HIS WIFE IN THE EVENT HE PREDECEASES HER. I WAS NOT NAMED AS A PARTY TO THE FINRA ACTION AND HAD NO INVOLVEMENT IN THE COMPANY'S DECISION TO SETTLE. IF CONSULTED BY STIS, REGARDING A SETTLEMENT, I WOULD HAVE OBJECTED TO THE SETTLEMENT AS I MAINTAIN THAT I HANDLED THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNTS DILIGENTLY AND ACCORDING TO THEIR STATED OBJECTIVES, INSTRUCTIONS AND DECISIONS. I DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SETTLEMENT NOR WAS I ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SETTLEMENT. CLIENT SUSTAINED NO MONETARY DAMAGES FROM THE TRANSACTIONS AT ISSUE.""
