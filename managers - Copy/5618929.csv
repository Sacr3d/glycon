  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The properties in my sole name were paid in full on dates due, however there are a few properties that were in both my dad's name and mine that are his responsibility as he is the one who rents them. He disputed tax bills and was waiting on ruling on bills, he has discussed this with the Clayton County Tax Commissioner and they are working to resolve issue. Again, I do not collect income from this property my name was just attached to deed I thought as successor but must have been in joint name. If anyone has questions I will be glad to share my computer desktop screen with them and log into clayton county tax commissioner website to explain more in detail and demonstrate where confusion lies. Thank you very much for bringing this to my attention as I just found out about this Friday 03.10.2017 when I received U-4 Regulatory email.""
