  ""Firm Name"" : ""People's Securities, Inc."",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""It was alleged, and the RR conceded, that he had signed initials onto customer paperwork in order to correct errors or non-conformances without involving customers, and then presented the documents to the firm for processing and suitability review indicating that the customer had initialed the corrections."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In order to complete a suitable transaction for my customer, in a timely manner, that would benefit their account with higher guaranteed rate, I called and spoke directly with client in question on April 23rd 2019, to confirm our face to face meeting, and was advised that he was unable to attend the meeting because of an unexpected medical situation, then gave me specific instructions and authority to initial the documents for correction as necessary on his behalf. This document was internal identity verification, not investment or paperwork from the carrier. Prior customer meetings were face to face, and completed all necessary forms, with the missing expiration date of license being added as CORRECTION asked to be initialed (by operations dept of People's) to secure the purchase of this fixed annuity. I have been unable to find anything in People's Securities written procedures that would identify adding initials to the documents under these circumstances and at his direction and knowledge as being a prohibited activity, however, this was the cause of my termination.""
