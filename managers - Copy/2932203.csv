  ""Broker Comment"" : ""OUR RECORDS REFLECT THE CLIENT'S RETIREMENT ACCT WAS ESTABLISHED WITH OUR FIRM ON 2/5/08 AND A FIDELITY FD WAS TRANSFERRED INTO THE ACCOUNT.  ACCORDING TO FA, THE FIDELITY FD WAS LIQUIDATED AND BONDS AND UNIT TRUSTS WERE PURCHASED WITH THE CLIENT'S APPROVAL. WHILE CLIENT'S LETTER INDICATES HER RETIREMENT ACCT BEGAN AT $118,000 AND ENDED WITH $9,800 WHEN SHE LEFT OUR FIRM, BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THE CLIENT'S ACCT WE MUST DISAGREE.  OUR RECORDS REFLECT CLIENT TRANSFERRED INTO OUR FIRM $70,271.34, 2008 DISTRIBUTIONS TOTALED $52,724.25, 2009 DISTRIBUTIONS TOTALED $9,393.74 AND HER ACCT WAS CLOSED 12/17/09.  IT DOES APPEAR BASED ON THIS INFO THAT THE CLIENT EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF $8,153.35 OR 11% AND NOT THE 75% SHE CLAIMED IN HER LETTER.  WE REALIZE THAT NO CLIENT LIKES TO EXPERIENCE A LOSS IN THEIR INVESTMENTS; HOWEVER, WE DID GO THROUGH A PERIOD OF UNPRECEDENTED MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH HAD AN IMPACT ON ACCT VALUATIONS.  IN ADDITION, MARKET FLUCTUATION IS A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING.  IN REGARD TO CLIENT'S SINGLE ACCT, MOST INVESTMENTS HELD IN THE ACCT WERE TRANSFERRED INTO OUR FIRM.  WE ARE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE COST BASIS; HOWEVER, IT DOES APPEAR CLIENT'S MUTUAL FUNDS ARE DOWN IN VALUE (APPROXIMATELY 10%).  LASTLY, CLIENT'S LETTER INDICATED CONCERNS RELATING TO HER DESIRE TO TRANSFER HER RETIREMENT ACCT TO ANOTHER FIRM.  ALL TRANSFERS MUST BE INITIATED BY THE RECEIVING FIRM AND WE SHOW NO RECORDS OF EVER RECEIVING TRANSFER PAPERWORK FOR HER RETIREMENT ACCT.  OUR RECORDS REFLECT THE BONDS HELD IN THE RETIREMENT ACCT WERE LIQUIDATED ON 12/11/09, A CHECK FOR THE PROCEEDS IN THE AMOUNT OF $9,393.74 WAS ISSUED TO HER ON 12/16/09 AND THE CHECK CLEARED ON 12/23/09.  ALL ACTIVITY WOULD HAVE BEEN REFLECTED ON THE DEC 2009 STATEMENT AND IT SEEMS CLIENT AGREED WITH THE DISTRIBUTION FROM HER RET. ACCT BY ACCEPTING AND DEPOSITING THE CHECK.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ACCORDING TO FA, CLIENT ORIGINALLY CONTACTED HER IN MARCH 2007 AND EXPRESSED HIS DESIRE TO EARN A HIGHER TAX-FREE INTEREST RATE THAN HE WAS CURRENTLY EARNING AT FIDELITY.  FA STATED SHE CONTACTED CLIENT IN MAY TO DISCUSS THE GOLDMAN SACHS HIGH YIELD MUNICIPAL FUND THAT WAS OPENING TO INVESTORS FOR A FEW DAYS.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THE FA REVIEWED CLIENT'S CURRENT INVESTMENT HOLDINGS, INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, GOALS AND RISK TOLERANCE.  FA HAS INDICATED SHE ALSO EXPLAINED THE DETAILS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS FUND, INCLUDING FUND OBJECTIVE, SHARE CLASSES, BREAKPOINTS AND SALES CHARGES.  FA STATED SHE ALSO REVIEWED THE DETAILS OF THE FUND WITH MRS. CLIENT AND THEY BOTH AGREED THIS INVESTMENT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR PORTFOLIO.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING CLIENT HAD BEEN TRAVELING AT OR AROUND THE TIME OF THE EMAIL AND FA SPOKE WITH MRS. CLIENT REGARDING THEIR CONCERNS.  FA BELIEVES SHE ADDRESSED THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE EMAIL; HOWEVER, CLIENTS MADE THE DECISION TO SELL THE FUND.  BASED ON OUR REVIEW, IT APPEARS FA DISCLOSED THE DETAILS OF THE FUND AND THE TRANSACTION WAS AUTHORIZED.  CLAIM DENIED.""
