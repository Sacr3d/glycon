  ""Broker Comment"" : ""PER CHARLES, \""I WAS CHARGED FOR GROWING MARIJUANA WHICH I USED FROM 1994 THROUGH 1997 WHILE RECUPERATING FROM A NEAR FATAL WORK RELATED INJURY. MY DOCTOR WAS AWARE OF THE USE. I FOUND THAT NOTHING I WAS BEING PRESCRIBED HAD ANY EFFECT ON THE NAUSEA, DIZZINESS, INSOMNIA, AND PAIN AND IT WAS SUGGESTED TO ME THAT I TRY THC. IT WORKED WELL AND ALLOWED ME TO REGAIN A SOMEWHAT NORMAL FUNCTIONALITY FROM THE ALMOST TOTAL INCAPACITY OF THE NECK INJURY. I HAVE A PERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY FROM THE ACCIDENT AND STILL SUFFER FROM SWELLING AND PAIN, WHICH I MANAGE THROUGH THE USE OF OTC PAINKILLERS AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (ASPIRIN AND TYLENOL). PER MY ATTORNEY'S ADVICE I SETTLED ON A MISDEMEANOR FOR POSSESSION OF THC TO GET THE WHOLE PROCESS OVER WITH AND AVOID FURTHER LEGAL FEES AND DELAYS.\""""
