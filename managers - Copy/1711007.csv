  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN 1980 I WENT TO SAN FRANCISCO FOR THE DAY WITH TWO GIRLFRIENDS. I HAD NO SPENDING MONEY, SO WE STOPPED AT A MACY'S DEPT. STORE SO I COULD RETURN A SWEATER FOR A REFUND. WHILE IN THE STORE THE GIRLS I WAS WITH BEGAN TO SHOPLIFT. WHEN I BECAME AWARE OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING, THEY TOLD ME THEY DID. THIS ALL THE TIME. USING VERY POOR JUDGEMENT, I JOINED THEM IN TAKING A RADIO AND SOME BATH TOWELS. AS WE LEFT THE STORE, WE WERE IMMEDIATELY PICKED UP BY STORE SECURITY. I HAD HELPED CARRY A BAG OF STOLEN PROPERTY OUT OF THE STORE. THEREFORE, I WAS CHARGED WITH PETTY THEFT AND CONSPIRACY TO PETTY THEFT. I SPENT ABOUT 10 HOURS IN JAIL.
