  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Westbrook consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he participated in private securities transactions totaling $350,335 without prior disclosure to or approval from his member firm. The findings stated that Westbrook solicited investors to purchase securities of a company that represented itself as a structured cash flow investment. Westbrook received a total of $14,013 in commissions in connection with his sales of the company's securities. Later, the company ceased business, owing nearly $300 million in unpaid investor payments. In a subsequent indictment, the United States charged the company and its owner with conspiracy to engage in mail and wire fraud related to the company's operations."",
