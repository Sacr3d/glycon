  ""Allegations"" : ""A former customer sent an email to the representative for a loss of $70,000 as a result of an alleged unauthorized private placement in 2012.  The complainant also alleged a loss of $100,000 by a third-party manager who was referred by the representative.  The complainant alleged that the complainant felt pressured by the representative to use the third-party manager and that the services provided by the third-party manager was subject to a fee sharing agreement with Ingalls which was undisclosed by the representative.  However, the complainant's account was never subject to a fee sharing agreement between the employing firm and the third-party manager.  After the initial complaint containing the aforementioned issues, the customer raised a third issue regarding a purchase of a note of a foreign issuer for the complainant's account for $90,000.  The matter has been settled with the client as of 03/22/2017."",
