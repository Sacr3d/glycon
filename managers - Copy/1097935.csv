  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS OFFENSE OCCURED WHEN I WAS 16 YEARS OLD.  A FRIEND AND I ENTERED 3 HOMES OF PEOPLE WE KNEW AND WE WERE CAUGHT AND CHARGED ACCORDINGLY. I WANT TO STRESS THAT THIS WAS AN UNFORTUNATE YOUTHFUL MISTAKE WHICH IN NO WAY REFLECTS MY CHARACTER AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP.  MY 5 YEAR PROBATION WAS TERMINATED AFTER 2 1/2 YEARS BECAUSE THE COURT REALIZED THAT A REPEAT OCCURENCE WAS UNLIKELY AND THAT CONTINUED COURT SUPERVISION WOULD SERVE NO USEFUL PURPOSE.""
