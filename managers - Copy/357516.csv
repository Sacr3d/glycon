  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Since 1970, whenever a client or policyholder requested a loan, I routinely explained the options to repay the loan, the interest rate applicable at the time of the loan, and the impact the loan has on the policy death benefit. As a minimum, I recommend that the loan interest be paid, on each policy anniversary. If it is not paid, it would compound onto the loan, and place the policy in jeopardy of lapsing. I would then suggest a comfortable repayment of the loan principal predicated on the client's financial circumstances.""
