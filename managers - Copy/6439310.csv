    ""Charges"" : ""CREDIT CARD - PRESENT OTHER 25 YEARS AGO, I LET MY THEN GIRLFRIEND BORROW $700 FOR  BILLS.  SHE DIDNT PAY IT BACK IN TWO WEEKS LIKE SHE AGREED WITH ME.  SHE HAD GIVEN ME A CREDIT CARD TO USE FOR NECESSITIES AS LONG AS I PAID THE CARD AT THE END OF THE MONTH. I WAS GIVEN THE CARD 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO THIS SCENARIO.   I CALLED HER ON JUNE 16TH MULTIPLE TIMES TO ADVISE HER ABOUT MY PROPOSITION TO ZERO OUT HER OUTSTANDING BALANCE. SHE DID NOT ANSWER. I DECIDED TO USE THE CARD FOR THE AMOUNT THAT SHE OWED ME. THAT WAY,  SHE WOULDNT HAVE TO PAY ME BACK IN CASH.  ONCE I TOLD HER,  SHE LOST IT. SHE TOOK THE CARD, CALLED THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY & TOLD THEM SHE DID NOT AUTHORIZE THE CHARGES. SOON AFTER, I RECEIVED A FELONY WARRANT FOR:  CREDIT CARD - PRESENT OTHER.  I OBTAINED AN ATTORNEY, WENT TO HARRIS COUNTY, AND WAS FINGER-PRINTED AND BOOKED ON 7/5/1989.
