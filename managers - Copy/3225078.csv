REPRESENTATIVE DENIES THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE UNSUITABLE.  ADDITIONALLY, REPRESENTATIVE HAS RECEIVED NO CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS. **UPDATE: IN ORDER TO SETTLE THIS MATTER & AVOID COSTLY LITIGATION, REPRESENTATIVE CONSENTED TO ONE INSTANCE OF RECOMMENDING TO A CONSUMER THE PURCHASE OF AN ANNUITY WITHOUT REASONABLE GROUNDS TO BELIEVE THAT THE RECOMMENDATION OR TRANSACTION WAS NOT UNSUITABLE.  THE TRANSACTION IN QUESTION OCCURED IN FEBRUARY 2005 AND THE CUSTOMER NEVER COMPLAINED AND WAS SATISFIED WITH THE INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATION PROVIDED BY THE REPRESENTATIVE.""
