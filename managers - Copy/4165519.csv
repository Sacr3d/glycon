  ""Judgment/Lien Amount"" : ""$1,990.00"",
  ""Judgment/Lien Type"" : ""Civil"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I was under the impression this judgement was discharged since the plaintiff never attempted to collect on the judgement and the item did not appear on my credit report. the plaintiff seemed satisfied with having me evicted from the premises. I do no ever recall them trying to collect the judgement and until notified by my local licensing coordinator, I assumed the issue was already discharged by the court. I don't ever recall receiving any written notification directly from the plaintiff that the judgement was renewed.""
