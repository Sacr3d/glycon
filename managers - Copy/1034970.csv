AFTER TALKING TO THE [CUSTOMER'S] THEY AGREED TO SEND TO ME A LETTER OF RECSISSION FAR THE ALLEAGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST ME. THEY THEN HAD SECOND THOUGHTS BECAUSE AT ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY HAD WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF OUR GREAT COMPANY. THE [CUSTOMERS] COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I WAS NEVER CONTACTED ABOUT THIS PROBLEM THAT THEY WERE HAVING. IF ANYONE WOULD HAVE ASKED THE [CUSTOMER'S] WHAT WAS MENNT, BY THEIR ALLEGATIONS YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THEIR INTERPUTATION WAS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN OURS. I WILL GET A RESCISSION LETTER FROM THE [CUSTOMER'S].""
