  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE [CUSTOMERS] ASKED ME TO REVIEW THE INSURANCE CONTRACTS THEY PURCHASED FROM CONSECO.  THE [CUSTOMERS] OBJECTIVE WAS ESTATE PLANNING AND INCOME REPLACEMENT.  WITH THE HELP OF [OTHER FIRM MEMBER], OUR INSURANCE SPECIALIST AT THE TIME, IT WAS RECOMMENDED TO REPLACE THE CONSECO POLICIES FOR 2 REASONS.  FIRST, CONSECO WAS BEING DOWNGRADED BY MANY ANALYSTS AT THE TIME.  SECOND, HARTFORD OFFERED TO INSURE THEM FOR LESS PREMIUM OR HIGHER FACE VALUE.  THEY CHOSE TO REDUCE THE PREMIUM AND HAVE IT PAID UP FASTER WITH HARTFORD.  THE [CUSTOMERS] HAVE BEEN GOOD CLIENTS AND WE HAVE BEEN REVIEWING THEIR INVESTMENTS AT LEAST TWICE TO 3 TIMES A YEAR DEPENDING ON THEIR UTAH VISITS.  THEY MAKE A POINT OF SEEING ME WHEN THEY ARE IN TOWN.  THE MOST RECENT TRANSACTION WE HAD WAS A CHANGE OF BROKER ON THEIR AMERICAN FUNDS AT THEIR REQUEST BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT GETTING GOOD SERVICE FROM THE ADVISOR.  [CUSTOMER] CALLED ME WHEN SHE GOT HER PREMIUM PAYMENT REQUEST.  SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT CANCELING THE POLICY SINCE SHE DIDN'T THINK SHE NEEDED IT.  I THEN CONFERENCED HER IN WITH [OTHER FIRM MEMBER], THE LIFE SPECIALIST, TO EXPLAIN HER OPTIONS IN CASE THERE IS A BETTER SOLUTION.  THERE WAS NEVER A MENTION OF UNHAPPINESS FROM HER.  HOWEVER, [OTHER FIRM MEMBER] RECOMMENDED TO HER A POSSIBLE 2ND TO DIE POLICY TO SAVE MONEY.  NOW THEY THINK THAT THE 2ND TO DIE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE POLICY TO HAVE FROM THE BEGINNING.  HOWEVER, THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT IT IS NOT AN OPTION TO TRANSFER FROM WHAT THEY HAD TO A 2ND TO DIE.  AS A GENERALIST, I HAVE TO RELY ON THE SPECIALISTS FOR RECOMMENDATIONS AND I BELIEVE THAT THE CHAMBERS HAD THE RIGHT CONTRACT FOR THE TIME.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I MET WITH THE HEWITTS FOR OVER 2 YEARS BEFORE THEY EVER INVESTED ANY MONEY. DURING OUR MEETING, I WAS VERY SPECIFIC WHEN I EXPLAINED THE ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES OF A TAX FREE BOND FUND. FURTHERMORE, I EXPLAINED THAT EVEN THOUGH THE MUNI BONDS ARE INSURED THEY CAN FLUCTUATE IN VALUE. I SHOWED THEM THE PERFORMANCE CHARTS & GRAPHS SO THEY CAN SEE HOW THE BONDS FLUCTUATED WHEN INTEREST RATES WENT UP & DOWN. IN MY OPINION THE HEWITTS KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED. THEY WANTED TAX FREE INCOME AND THE FUNDS WERE APPROPRIATE CONSIDERING THEIR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES.""
