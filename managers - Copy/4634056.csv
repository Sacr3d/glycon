  ""Allegations"" : ""WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, JOHNSON CONSENTED TO THE SANCTION AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT HE ATTEMPTED TO CONVERT FUNDS FROM HIS MEMBER FIRM. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT JOHNSON SUBMITTED 11 TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSE REPORTS TO HIS MEMBER FIRM SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT FOR $9,700 IN EXPENSES HE HAD INCURRED.

THE FIRM DISCOVERED THE FALSE EXPENSE REPORTS AND REFUSED TO PAY THE PERSONAL EXPENSES. BY SUBMITTING FALSE EXPENSE REPORTS, JOHNSON CAUSED THE FIRM TO MAINTAIN INACCURATE BOOKS AND RECORDS. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT JOHNSON FAILED TO APPEAR AND PROVIDE TESTIMONY REQUESTED BY FINRA."",
