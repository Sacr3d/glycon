FURTHERMORE, MY FORMER BROKER-DEALER RELEASED A U-5 THAT MISTAKENLY OMITTED THIS ANSWER. IN RESPONSE TO THE ALLEGED COMPLAINT, THE CUSTOMER MISTOOK MY ANSWER REGARDING EARLY SURRENDER CHARGES WITH AN EARLY WITHDRAWAL (PRE 59 1/2) PENALTY FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. I EXPLAINED THAT SHE WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS PENALTY BECAUSE SHE HAD REACHED AGE 59 1/2 BUT SHE MISINTERPRETED MY EXPLANATION. I DID DISCLOSE THE PENALTY.""
