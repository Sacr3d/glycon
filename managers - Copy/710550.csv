  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS CLAIM IS WHOLLY WHITHOUT MERIT.  CLAIMANT IS DECEASED HUSBAND'S SECOND WIFE.  DECEASED HUSBAND PURCHASED A LIFE INSURACE POLICY IN 1987 DESIGNATING HIS FIRST WIFE AS BENEFICIARY.  HE NEVER COMPLAINED ABOUT THE POLICY DURING HIS LIFETIME.  HIS FIRST WIFE DIED IN 1991.  DECEASED HUSBAND NEVER CHANGED THE BENEFICIARY ON HIS POLICY TO HIS SECOND WIFE, THE CLAIMANT, AFTER THEY MARRIED IN 1993.  AFTER THE HUSBAND DIED, BOTH CLAIMANT AND HUSBAND'S ESTATE SOUGHT THE DEATH BENEFITS.  MERRILL LYNCH DECIDED TO PLACE THE DEATH BENEFITS IN COURT PURSUANT TO AN INTERPLEADER ACTION AND ALLOW A COURT TO DETERMINE WHETHER CLAIMANT OR DECEASED HUSBAND'S ESTATE SHOULD GET THE DEATH BENEFITS.  CLAIMANT AND DECEASED HUSBAND'S ESTATE SETTLED THEIR DISUPTE, AND A RELEASE WAS SIGNED BY ALL PARTIES INCLUDING MERRILL LYNCH LIFE INSURANCE CO. OF NEW YORK.""
