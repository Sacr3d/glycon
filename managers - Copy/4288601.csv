  ""Type"" : ""Bankruptcy"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I was forced into Bankruptcy CH 13 due to my ex-husband filing CH 13 a year and a half ago. All the financial debts he was petitioned by the court to pay in the divorce decree are now coming after me for prompt payment; hence the judgment listed on my U4 currently. I received additional judgment notification and was advised by my attorney that CH 13 was the best approach to cease all these judgments until this could be resolved in Divorce Court. I am very responsible and do not mishandle my own assets.""
