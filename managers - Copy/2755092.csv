  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS IS THE RESULT OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR. I COMPLETED 17 CREDIT HOURS ON 9-1-2005 ON THE FIRM'S SYSTEM WHEREBY ONLY 15 WERE NEEDED BY DEC. 31, 2005.  SOME OF THE HOURS WERE INADVERTENTLY NOT REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE'S RECORDING SYSTEM.  THIS OVERSIGHT PUT ME 2 HOURS BELOW THE NEEDED CREDIT.  I WAS NOT AWARE OF THAT FACT UNTIL I WAS NOTIFIED WHEN TRYING TO REINSTATE MY INSURANCE LICENSE. .  NOT KNOWING WHY I WAS SHORT, I DID AN ADDITIONAL 3 CREDIT HOURS IN APRIL OF 2006 TO GET ABOVE THE 15 NEEDED HOURS.  UNFORTUNATELY THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ISSUED A FINE OF $150 FOR A LATE COMPLETION, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A SYSTEM ERROR. THE FINE WAS PAID AND THE LICENSE WAS RENEWED AND IS NOW CURRENT.""
