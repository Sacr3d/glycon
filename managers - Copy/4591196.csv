  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I MET WITH THE CLIENTS, [CUSTOMERS], ON 2/13/07. PRODUCT DISCUSSED AND RECOMMENDED WAS A CLAYMORE MAAPS UIT THAT HAD A 2 YEAR DURATION. THE CLAYMORE MAAPS IS A 100% STOCK INVESTMENT WITH A COST OF APPROXIMATELY 2.5% TO ENTER. AS IS WITH ALL THE UIT'S WE HAD AT CHASE, THE COST IS SPREAD OUT OVER THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. ALL DISCLOSURES WERE READ, DISCUSSED,  AND SIGNED BY THE CLIENT. THE CLIENT WAS FREE TO MOVE OUT OF THE PRODUCT AT ANY TIME HOWEVER, IF DONE WITHIN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS, THE CLIENT WOULD STILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNPAID PORTION OF THE INITIAL COST OF ENTRY.  NINE MONTHS INTO THE DURATION OF THE PRODUCT, I LEFT CHASE FOR ANOTHER FIRM. AT THAT TIME, THE PRODUCT WAS PERFORMING TO THE CLIENT'S SATISFACTION.   WHEN I LEFT CHASE, PER MY AGREEMENT, I DID NOT RETAIN ANY CLIENT FILES, CONTACTS ETC. IT WAS ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT UPON MY DEPARTURE, ALL CLIENTS AND CLIENT FILES WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER FINANCIAL ADVISOR WITHIN CHASE INVESTMENT SERVICES SO THAT THE CLIENT WOULD CONTINUE BEING SERVICED WITH REVIEW OF THE PRODUCT AND PROVIDED ANY OPTIONS THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY CONTACT OR COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLIENT AS OF MY DEPARTURE DATE OF 12-3-07.  4/27/09 - CHASE INVESTMENT SERVICES DENIED THE CLIENT'S CLAIM ON 3/27/09.""

I THINK IT IS NOTABLE THAT WHILE SHPENDING 4.5 YEARS WITH CHASE I DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE COMPLAINT.  EVERY COMPLAINT HAS BEEN FROM CHASE CUSTOMERS AND AFTER I LEFT THEIR EMPLOYMENT.  IN NOT ONE INSTANCE HAS CHASE EVER CONTACTED ME DURING THEIR INVESTIGATION AND PRIOR TO MAKING ANY DECISION ON ANY OF THE COMPLAINTS.  IN ALL INSTANCES, I HAVE RECEIVED NOTIFICATION POST MORTEM.""

I DENY THAT ANY UIT PURCHASE MADE BY [CUSTOMER] THROUGH ME WAS MISREPRESENTED.  I PRESENTED THE UIT AS MANAGEMENT OF CISC REQUESTED, IN PARTICULAR [MANAGER], AREA MANAGER, [MANAGER], STATE MARKET MANAGER AND [MANAGER], DISTRICT MANAGER.
