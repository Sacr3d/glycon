CFS USED AN AVERAGE PRICE ACCOUNT TO CONSOLIDATE THESE TRADES. IN THE COURSE OF CONSOLIDATION, THESE TRADES WERE TEMPORARILY HELD IN AN ACCOUNT BEARING CFS' NAME. THE SEC CLAIMED THAT EVEN TEMPORARILY HOLDING THE SECURITIES IN CFS' ACCOUNT VIOLATED SECURITES LAWS. UPON NOTIFICATION CFS IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED THE PROCEDURE. THE TRADES DID NOT IMPOSE ANY FINANCIAL ADVERSITY ON THE CLIENTS. PRINCIPAL TRADE MARK UPS AND MARK DOWNS WERE EQUIVALENT COMMISSIONS BEING CHARGED ON AN AGENCY BASIS.""
