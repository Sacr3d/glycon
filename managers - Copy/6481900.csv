  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In April, 2017 I sub-leased an apartment in the East Village.  About a year later when the lease ended a dispute arose over the security deposit between the landlord and the tenant.  Unbeknownst to me, the tenant then filed a judgement against me and the landlord.  I am currently disputing this action with the local court.  Once resolved, I will provide any final documentation.""
