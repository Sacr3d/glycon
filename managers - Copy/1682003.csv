  ""Firm Name"" : ""GWFS Equities, Inc."",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Voluntary Resignation"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""At the time of his resignation, the Firm was investigating Mr. Verdi for possible violations of FINRA rule 3720 and the Firm's Code of Conduct, which require the disclosure of Outside Business Activities and potential conflicts of interest."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I voluntarily resigned from Empower Retirement (GWFS) on 10/12/20. A U5 was then issued by the firm (GWFS). However, on 10/30 the firm issued an amended U5 and made a disclosure on the U5 in Section 7F(1) stating I \""voluntarily resigned but was under investigation for possible violation of FINRA 3720 (should be 3270) regarding having an Outside Business activity\"". This is a false and misleading statement.  At no time during my employment was I informed either orally or in writing that I was under investigation for any rule violation. In addition, I did not have any Outside Business activity. Their statement on the U5 could only be based on a phone call approximately 1 week before my voluntary resignation inquiring about me sending Power Point plan sponsor presentations in July 2020 to my personal email address. On the phone call, I provided a full explanation both to the Compliance Representative as well as my Manager as to the reason for the communications.  The reason was to facilitate the delivery of a number of Virtual presentations to an audience using both a work laptop for the presentation slides and my personal laptop for reading the compliance approved script. There was no outside business activity involved, and no personal customer information or PII was involved with these presentations. The presentations and scripts were generic customized presentations for retirement plan sponsors and their participants. Following the phone call, I did not receive any further communication from the Compliance department on this matter.  For the firm to suggest anything otherwise is totally inaccurate and intended to impugn my reputation. Furthermore, after the amendment was filed, I immediately contacted my former manager and the compliance officer by email and phone for an explanation. They never responded.  In addition to the misstated rule on the U5, they posted an incorrect Termination date of 10/9/20 instead of 10/12/20. Starting on 10/13/20, several attempts were made to have this corrected by the firm as well with no results. Through the BrokerCheck Dispute process, I have requested that this Firm disclosure be removed from my FINRA record so that a potential firm or client would not reach or draw an incorrect conclusion based on their uninformed statement.""
