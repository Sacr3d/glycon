  ""Broker Comment"" : ""AT THE TIME OF THIS EVENT, THE KNAPP COMMISSION HEARINGS ON POLICE CORRUPTION WAS GOING ON.  WHEN I GOT STOPPED FOR SPEEDING I TRIED TO HAVE THE OFFICER GIVE ME A BREAK - COULDN'T AFFORD THE TICKET.  I HAD NO MONEY ON ME AND IT WAS THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE TO BRIBE ANYONE.  I DID NOT TRY TO BRIBE ANYONE EVER - THEY THOUGHT I WAS AN UNDERCOVER POLICEMAN AND ARRESTED ME.  I WAS A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES.  HAD I MORE FINANCIAL RESOURCES, I WOULD HAVE FOUGHT CASE FURTHER.  I WAS NOT GUILTY OF ANYTHING BUT SPEEDING - AND THAT WAS DISMISSED.""
