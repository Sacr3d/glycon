453,5126374,DUSTIN,[DUSTIN B LUCKETT],LUCKETT,6/19/2017,Employment Separation After Allegations,,"{
  ""Firm Name"" : ""J.P. MORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A."",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Non-securities related.  RR was terminated for having a customer sign a document and then, on the next day, asking a co-worker whether he could notarize the document without customer present; the co-worker then notarized the document for RR in violation of firm policy.  In addition, after the allegations were made regarding the notarization issue, firm concluded RR engaged in conduct it deemed inconsistent with its anti-retaliation policies."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I deny JP Morgan Chase's (JPMC) characterization of the events used to justify my termination, and in particular deny that I engaged in any form of retaliation.  I believe all assertions placed on my Form U5 were purposely put there in order to hamper my future employment prospects and coerce existing clients to remain with JPMC. What JPMC omitted was that on April 8, 2017, I began looking for outside employment due to how JPMC was handling client retirement accounts, limiting investment options to their own portfolios, changing management, etc. and JPMC discovered this on May 15, 2017. After being recognized year after year for exceptional performance and client satisfaction, it is convenient that I am suddenly let go without warning or notice for such highly controversial reasons I will outline below.    The incident for which JPMC let me go involved a customer whom I jointly serviced along with a banker on the Chase Bank side of the company.  During the course of our meetings with this customer, the customer filled out and signed investment-related forms. It was not until a couple days later when preparing to send in the forms that I realized the need for the customer's signature to be notarized.  Since I am not a notary, have never been given any verbal or written training on notary rules, and am not familiar with notarization rules in Kentucky, I spoke to the banker who jointly serviced the client and asked him whether it was permissible for him to notarize the document even though the customer had already signed. The banker indicated that he could. It was later determined he acted correctly and properly under Kentucky rules. If necessary, the signature could even be verified against bank signature cards, and days prior, we had jointly witnessed the client's Driver's License.  Relying on his knowledge of the rules governing him as a notary, I brought him the document, which he notarized. Again, having never been trained by JPMC or anyone else on notary rules, I had no knowledge about whether the banker was acting properly and will never understand how JPMC considered my actions in these events to be with intent.    My sales assistant, who had been the one to raise a red flag on the notary issue above, had stopped coming to work at my branch soon after and was only answering my phone remotely and providing no other services. I acknowledge that I requested to swap sales assistants with another advisor, but what JPMC also fails to mention was my repeated requests for nearly 2 years prior to be assigned a new assistant due to her on-going poor performance and client complaints. My request for a new assistant after the notary event was not retaliation for what took place, but rather because I no longer had an assistant who was coming to work and a continuation of my on-going requests for a new assistant that had started 2 years earlier. These requests can be verified by my manager in addition to written records. Once again, I deny having engaged in any conduct that comes close to retaliation and reiterate that JPMC has made these claims unwarranted and unjustified.""
