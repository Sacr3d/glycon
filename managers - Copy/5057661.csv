  ""Judgment/Lien Amount"" : ""$32,688.24"",
  ""Judgment/Lien Type"" : ""Tax"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This tax amount/lien came from medical expenses incurred while taking care of my mother along with her wake and funeral costs.  She became sick and I was the primary care giver and I needed to access my funds to keep her alive.  My accountant at the time said he filed an addendum along with my hand written letter explaining what happened and why our income was so high that year as the final numbers were incorrect but it seemed to just drag on through the CPA and IRS with notices back and forth.  I reached out to the IRS directly and we will be taking direct action and making monthly payments to settle this debt.""
