  ""Broker Comment"" : ""WHEN OVER AT ROBERT TODD FINANCIAL, I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FIRM TOOK CARE OF ALL STATE REGISTRATION FEES.  UNFORTUNATELY WHEN I HAD RESIGNED THAT WAS NOT THE CASE, SO THERE WAS AN OPEN DEBT FOR THE STATE OF MICHIGAN FOR THE FEE.  I WAS INFORMED OF THAT WHEN I HAD TRANSFERRED MY LICENSE TO DESCAP SECURITIES.  IN SHORT, I HAD RESOLVED IT BY PAYING THE FEE, FIGURING THAT YES ON THE U-4 WOULD BY CHANGED TO A NO.  I WAS WRONG. NOW THAT YOU HAVE AN EXPLANATION AND THE STATE HAS THE FEE RESOLVED, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD LIFT THE YES TO TURN IT INTO A NO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IN THIS MATTER.""
