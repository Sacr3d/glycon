  ""Judgment/Lien Amount"" : ""$26,884.53"",
  ""Judgment/Lien Type"" : ""Tax"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Mr. Danowsky self reported to the IRS that his employer failed to send him two 1099's from 2013 for income earned.  He self reported this to the IRS in 2016 at which time a payment plan was put in place for the amount due.  Mr. Danowsky is current on the payment plan and has made numerous calls to the IRS inquiring as to why he was never notified that a lien was filed.  To this day the IRS states that a lien has not been filed however the firm was able to pull one from San Diego County.  Mr. Danowsky is presently working with the IRS to have the lien removed through their official appeal process.""
