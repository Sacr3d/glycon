  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Admin Releases 34-76528; IA release 40-4284/ November 30, 2015: The Securities and Exchange Commission (\""Commission\"") deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Michael L. Shea (\""Shea\"" or \""Respondent). On the basis of this Order and Respondent's Offer, the Commission finds that: From September 2009 until July 2013, Shea was a vice president and the business development director at a registered investment adviser (IA). From at least August 2010 until March 2013, the IA, its principal, and Shea created and distributed to clients and prospective clients performance advertising that failed to disclose with sufficient prominence and detail that the IA's Global Tactical Multi Asset Class Strategies' (\""GTMACS\"") advertised performance was hypothetical rather than actual. The IA's principal created the GTMACS' performance data by back-testing static models dating back to 1999 and consisting of indices that generated minimized volatility and maximized returns, before either the IA or the GTMACS existed. While the IA provided several pieces of performance advertising generally disclosing its use of \""certain hypothetical performance and portfolio information,\"" that disclosure was imprecise, often not on the same page as the hypothetical performance data, and contrary to other statements indicating that the GTMACS' performance data represented actual rather than hypothetical returns. Shea also generated some performance advertising emails without any disclosure language and distributed it to a limited number of prospective clients. In addition, the IA's advertising included examples of favorable investment decisions showing returns of up to 58.62 percent without providing or offering to provide all the firm's investment decisions, and select client portfolios showing over 28 percent in annualized gains without determining whether those gains represented all the IA clients. As a result of the conduct, Shea willfully aided and abetted and caused the IA's violations of Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rules 206(4)-1(a)(2) & (5) thereunder. Shea knew or was generally aware of the potential of the hypothetical GTMACS' model performance, tactical applications of the GTMACS, and sample client portfolios in the IA's marketing materials to mislead clients and prospective clients about its actual performance. Shea also knowingly or recklessly provided substantial assistance to the IA's primary antifraud and advertising violations by co-authoring the IA's advertising materials and creating and distributing performance advertising without any disclosure that the GTMACS' model performance data was hypothetical."",
