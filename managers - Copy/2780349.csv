  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I STRONGLY OBJECT TO [CUSTOMER'S] WRITTEN COMPLAINT AND REFUTE THESE BASELESS ACCUSATIONS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT.  SINCE I NO LONGER WORK FOR CHASE, I AM UNABLE TO SPECIFICALLY REFERENCE HIS CLIENT FILE AND THE DETAILED NOTES CONTAINED WITHIN IT.  HOWEVER, I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT [CUSTOMER'S] COMPLAINT FALSELY REFERENCES THE PRODUCT THAT HE WAS INVESTED IN, AS WELL AS INAPPROPRIATELY CHALLENGES MY CHARACTER.    I HAVE ALWAYS ACTED IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF MY CLIENTS AND OPERATE WITH A STRONG SENSE OF FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY.  BEFORE I WOULD PUT ANY CLIENT INTO AN INVESTMENT, I SEEK TO CLARIFY THE CLIENTS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, CURRENT FINANCIAL SITUATION, INVESTMENT TIME HORIZONS AND DISCLOSE ANY RISKS TO DETERMINE THE PROPER SUITABILITY FOR MY CLIENTS.  I ACTED IN THE SAME MANOR WITH [CUSTOMER'S] INVESTMENT.  UNFORTUNATELY, I BELIEVE THIS COMPLAINT WAS WRITTEN AS A RESULT OF THE UNPRECEDENTED FIXED INCOME MARKET ENVIRONMENT.""
