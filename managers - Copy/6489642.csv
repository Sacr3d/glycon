  ""Allegations"" : ""On January 4, 2018, Mohamed H. Eldawy (\""Respondent\"") was discharged from Morgan Stanley for allegedly using personal email to solicit clients.  On February 8, 2018, Respondent applied for registration with the Securities Commissioner as an agent of Vestech Securities, LLC.  On January 11, 2018, Respondent began the onboarding process with Regulus Advisors LLC (\""Regulus\"").  The onboarding paperwork Respondent filled out contained questions relating to discharges or terminations from prior firms. Respondent answered \""No\"" to the termination disclosure questions. At this time, Respondent had not received a copy of his Form U5 from Morgan Stanley. On January 19, 2018, Morgan Stanley mailed a copy of Respondent's U5 to Respondent. Thereafter, Respondent was aware of the affirmative answer to the termination disclosure question on Respondent's Form U5 and the need to update Respondent's onboarding paperwork with Regulus to report the termination from Morgan Stanley but Respondent did not do so.  On January 25, 2018, Respondent's Form U4 with Regulus was filed containing a \""No\"" answer to the termination question. Accordingly, Respondent submitted an inaccurate Form U4 to the Securities Commissioner.  On January 26, 2018, Regulus became aware of Respondent's inaccurate filing and chose not to move forward with Respondent's registration as an agent of Regulus. It is Ordered that the agent registration of Mohamed H. Eldawy with the Securities Commissioner is hereby SUSPENDED for a for a period of sixty (60) days."",
