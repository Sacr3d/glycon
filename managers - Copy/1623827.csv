  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Simone consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he borrowed a total of $133,000 from two of his elderly member firm customers, without notifying or receiving prior approval from the firm. The findings stated that Simone received loans totaling $43,000 from the first customer, and loans totaling $90,000 from the second customer. The customers were not immediate members of Simone's family, and were both approximately 71 years old as of the first loans. The loans Simone received from the first customer were not documented in a writing, but the customer understood that the funds would be returned in full, with 12% interest, within one year. The loans Simone received from the second customer were documented in two promissory notes and executed by the customer and Simone. Both promissory notes provided that the loan would be repaid in full, with 15% interest, within 120 days. Simone repaid the second customer in full, plus interest, and repaid the first customer approximately $8,000. Simone also falsely stated on two compliance questionnaires that he had not borrowed funds from a client, and made a false statement to the first customer in order to obtain additional time to repay the loans. The findings also stated that Simone created and submitted falsified firm account statements and supporting documents to a third-party bank in support of his mortgage application. Simone created and submitted three false documents: an account statement for his personal firm account, which he falsified using customer information to reflect that the value of the assets was approximately $30,000 instead of $10,000; a pay stub issued by the firm, which he falsified to reflect deferred compensation due and owing to him in the amount of $95,250; and an employment verification letter that Simone executed using the name of a sales assistant who he misrepresented was a member of the firm's human resources department."",
