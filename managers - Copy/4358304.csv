  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN SEPTEMBER OF 2007 I MADE A MISTAKE IN JUDGEMENT BY DISCARDING ANNUITY AGREEMENTS. I DISCOVERED THEM IN MY OFFICE ONE EVENING. THEY WERE ALL PRETTY DATED. I SHOULD HAVE CONFIRMED THAT DISCARDING THEM WAS ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE OF THE TIME THAT HAD PASSED. I MADE A MISTAKE BY NOT CHECKING. AT THAT TIME I HAD BEEN WORKING 50-70 HOURS PER WEEK. I ALSO HAD A LOT OF THINGS IN MY LIFE GOING ON THAT I THINK CONTRIBUTED TO MY LACK OF JUDGEMENT. I RECEIVED THE BACKING OF MID AND TOP LEVEL MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, A GROUP OF ATTORNEYS DECIDED ON TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. THEY CHOSE TERMINATION OVER ALLOWING ME TO RESIGN. I HAD SIX YEARS OF SERVICE WITH A SPOTLESS RECORD BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH. THIS WAS A MISTAKE THAT I CERTAINLY LEARNED FROM AND ONE I HAVE BEEN HONEST ABOUT FROM THE BEGINNING.""
