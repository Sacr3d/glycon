  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN DEC, 1988, I WAS IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT: HOSPITALIZED AND DISABLED, UNABLE TO WORK UNTIL 11-27-89. MY EMPLOYER HAD RENEWED ALL MY LICENSES. THE POWERS CORP CLOSED 2-10-89. I MOVED INTO AN APARTMENT THAT ACCOMODATED A WHEELCHAIR. MY MAIL WAS FORWARDED FOR 90 DAYS. I DID NOT RECEIVE A NOTICE FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. I DID NOT NOTIFY ANY STATES OF THE ADDRESS CHANGE BECAUSE I WAS NOT ACTIVELY WORKING AS A BROKER IN 1989 UNTIL 11-27-89. I BELIEVE POWERS PAID FOR THE RENEWAL IN GOOD FAITH SINCE IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN $15.00. WITH THE CLOSING OF POWERS ON 2-10-89, THEY PROBABLY WERE UNAWARE OF THE INCREASE. ALSO, I ONLY CHECKED THE REGISTRATION IN ILLINOIS BECAUSE FOR 1989 ILLINOIS WAS THE ONLY STATE I DID BUSINESS WITH.""
