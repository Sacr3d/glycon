  ""Firm Name"" : ""MORGAN STANLEY SMITH BARNEY"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""DISCHARGED- MANAGEMENT LOSS OF CONFIDENCE RELATED TO EMPLOYEE'S ALTERATION OF A CLIENT DOCUMENT"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN 2012, OUR CLIENT SIGNED A MORGAN STANLEY DISCRETIONARY ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT FORM.  THE CLIENT SIGNED THE DOCUMENT BUT NEGLECTED TO DATE IT.  THE PAPERWORK WAS SUBMITTED FOR PROCESSING AND WAS ULTIMATELY REJECTED BECAUSE THE DATE WAS NOT INCLUDED ON THE FORM.  BY THAT TIME, THE CLIENT WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND WAS TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE TO BE REACHED TO CORRECT THE DEFICIENCY.  IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE PROCESSING OF THE CLIENT'S FORM, I PRINTED THE DATE THAT THE CLIENT AND OUR TEAM HAD AGREED TO, AND RESUBMITTED THE FORM FOR PROCESSING.  AS A RESULT OF MY ADDING THE DATE, I WAS TERMINATED FROM MORGAN STANLEY.  MY INTENT WAS NOT TO VIOLATE ANY RULES OR REGULATIONS, BUT TO ASSIST THE CLIENT IN FACILITATING THE OPENING OF HIS ACCOUNT.""
