  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CUSTOMER WAS REFERRED TO ME IN 2008 SEEKING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. I REVIEWED THE CUSTOMERS VARIABLE & FIXED ANNUITY CONTRACTS, 401K STATEMENTS,PENSION PLAN, BANK STATEMENTS, ETC. WE MET A TOTAL OF 8 TIMES RANGING FROM 45-90 MINUTES TO REVIEW AND EXPLAIN THE CUSTOMERS FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS. AFTER MANY HOURS OF MEETING AND COMPLETING SUITABILITY REQUIREMENTS THE CUSTOMER PURCHASED THE METLIFE ANNUITY IN 2008. NOW 2 YEARS LATER THE CUSTOMER WANTED TO REMOVE THE FUNDS STATING THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT AWARE OF FEES. THIS STATEMENT IS NOT TRUE. I REVIEWED THE CHARGES AND FEES SEVERAL TIMES AND SHE SIGNED THE APPLICATION ENSURING THE CUSTOMER HAD A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE CUSTOMER WAS DOING. THEREFORE, THIS COMPLAINT IS WITHOUT MERIT.""
