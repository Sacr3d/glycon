  ""Broker Comment"" : ""REP'S STATEMENT: THE AMERICAN GENERAL FIXED ANNUITY POLICY WAS SOLD TO CUSTOMER BY A FORMER EMPLOYEE ON 02/13/1998.  CUSTOMER WAS BLIND, AND ON HIS ORIGINAL ANNUITY PAPERWORK HE SIGNED HIS NAME WITH AN \""X\"" AND NAMED HIS SISTER AS THE PRIMARY AND ONLY BENEFICIARY. ON 12/27/2000, THE CUSTOMER AND HIS GIRLFRIEND DROPPED BY THE BRANCH TO SIGN A BENEFICIARY CHANGE FORM.  I HAD NEVER PREVIOUSLY MET THIS CLIENT AND AFTER THE BENEFICIARY FORM WAS COMPLETED, I TOOK THE FORM, MADE PHOTO-COPIES, AND MAILED THE ORIGINAL IN AN ENVELOPE ADDRESSED TO AMERICAN GENERAL. I NEXT HEARD FROM CUSTOMER'S GIRLFRIEND IN SEPTEMBER 2001, WHEN SHE WANTED TO FILE A CLAIM ON THE POLICY.  APPARENTLY, CUSTOMER DIED ON 06/19/2001 AND HIS SISTER HAD ALREADY CLAIMED THE ANNUITY AND RECEIVED THE FUNDS. WHEN I CONTACTED AMERICAN GENERAL, A REP TOLD ME THE COMPANY HAD NEVER RECEIVED THE BENEFICIARY CHANGE FORM.  ALTHOUGH I HAD COPIES, THEY WERE RESISTANT TO ACCEPT THEM, ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY HAD ALREADY PAID OUT THE ANNUITY. I FELT I MADE THE NECESSARY EFFORTS TO EXECUTE THIS CLIENT'S REQUEST.  I SENT THE REQUEST TO AMERICAN GENERAL AND FEEL IT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO CHANGE THE INFORMATION PROPERLY, OR CONTACT THE CLIENT IF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IS NOT SUFFICIENT.""
