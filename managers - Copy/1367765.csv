THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CUSTOMERS CANNOT BE DETERMINED BY SALMON SMITH BARNEY. MR. CASE IS NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THE SETTLEMENT. MR. CASE HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACTS INVOLVED IN THIS MATTER. IT APPEARS HE WAS NAMED IN THE COMPLAINT BECAUSE HE WAS AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF SALOMON SMITH BARNEY AND/OR SERVED ON THE FIRM'S OPERATING COMMITTEE. IN ADDITION, CLAIMANTS' COUNSEL HAS CONFIRMED THAT CLAIMANTS HAVE NO CLAIMS AGAINST MR. CASE.""
