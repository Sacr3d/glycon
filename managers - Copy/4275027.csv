  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON THE EVENING OF 03/10/2013 I WAS PULLED OVER FOR MAKING AN ILLEGAL LEFT TURN WHILE DRIVING MY 5 MONTH OLD SON TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.  AFTER THE POLICE OFFICER ASKED IF I HAD ANYTHING TO DRINK AND I RESPONDED THAT I HAD BEEN BARBEQUING AND HAD A COUPLE OF BEERS HE BECAME AGGRESSIVE WITH HIS INTERROGATION METHODS.  THE POLICE OFFICER ALSO SHOWED GREAT SKEPTICISM OF THE IMMEDIATE MEDICAL NEEDS THAT MY SON HAD AND ORDERED ME TO PERFORM A FIELD SOBRIETY TEST.  I WAS EXTREMELY CONCERNED FOR MY SON AND AGITATED WITH THE TACTICS AND ATTITUDE OF THE POLICE OFFICER.  I STATED THAT IF HE INTENDS TO QUESTION ME FURTHER HE NEEDED TO CALL AN EMT FOR MY SON AND I NEEDED A LAWYER BEFORE ANSWERING ANYMORE OF HIS QUESTIONS.  AFTER MUCH CONJOINING AND MANY DISRESPECTFUL ALLEGATIONS THE POLICE OFFICER FINALLY ALLOWED THE EMT TO TAKE MY SON TO THE ER WHERE HE WAS LATER ADMITTED FOR [REDACTED].  I WAS ARRESTED FOR A FELONY DWI WITH A CHILD UNDER 15 YRS. OLD IN THE VEHICLE, BOOK AND MY BLOOD WAS DRAWN.  I COOPERATED WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND MADE BAIL THE NEXT MORNING. I AM CURRENTLY AWAITING THE RESULTS OF MY BLOOD TEST AND HAVE HIRED A LAW TEAM TO HANDLE THIS UNFORTUNATE EVENT""
