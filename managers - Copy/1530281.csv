RESPONDENT LESNIKOWSKI APPROVED THE CLASS B SHARES PURCHASES EXECUTED BY AN INDIVIDUAL.  THESE PURCHASES WERE MADE IN VIOLATION OF FIRM POLICY THAT EXPRESSLY REQUIRED PRE-APPROVAL, BY A BRANCH MANAGER, OF MUTUAL FUND TRANSACTIONS OVER $100,000.  FURTHERMORE, THESE PURCHASES WERE MADE IN CONTRAVENTION OF A PROHIBITION CONTAINED IN THE FUND PROSPECTUS AGAINST PURCHASES OF CLASS B SHARES OVER $250,000.  RESPONDENT LESNIKOWSKI FAILED TO CONSIDER THE CLASS OF MUTUAL FUND PURCHASED WHEN PERFORMING THE SUITABILITY REVIEW OF THE TRANSACTIONS.  RESPONDENT LESNIKOWSKI'S FAILURE TO SUPERVISE AN INDIVIDUAL IN A REASONABLE AND PROPER MANNER ALLOWED THE INDIVIDUAL TO ENGAGE IN UNSUITABLE TRADING ACTIVITY IN A CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT."",
