  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Mr. Valentine was named as a defendant in a securities class action filed in Texas state court by purchasers of two Texas Limited Partnerships issued by Payson Petroleum. The allegations are securities fraud claims against the issuer, its officers and promoters. Several broker dealers which sold the offerings including the managing broker dealer and Financial West Group were also named as were the officers of those companies. The complaint alleges that officers of the various broker-dealers acted as \""control persons\"" and are thus liable for the alleged fraud of the issuer. There are no specific claims of direct fraud against these alleged control person parties, only that they \""controlled\"" the primary alleged wrongdoers.  Mr. Valentine intends to vigorously defend himself, and will seek to have the claims dismissed voluntarily, or as part of a Motion to Dismiss, since there appears to be no basis to name Mr. Valentine under the theories alleged""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""With regard to due diligence, FINRA found that the firm's written supervisory procedures did not fully articulate the due diligence process for private placement offerings, and that the firm failed to follow the written supervisory procedures for documenting those due diligence procedures.  However, there was no finding that the firm failed to perform adequate due diligence of private placement offerings.  With regard to FINRA's finding that the firm employed a statutorily-disqualified person, the firm's prior President temporarily employed his son as an assistant.  This individual was neither involved in the sale of securities nor the performance of due diligence review on behalf of the firm.""
