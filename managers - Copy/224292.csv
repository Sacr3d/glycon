  ""Allegations"" : ""Goldman was the subject of a 1986 regulatory action, initiated by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., involving late filing of FOCUS reports by a firm with which Goldman was associated.  The action specified that Goldman was not directly responsible for the late filing but was involved in the action due to his title.  The firm was fined $250 as a result of this regulatory action.  Goldman was the subject of two tax liens held by the New York State Tax Authority.  According to Goldman, one of these debts, for $48,205, is not personal to him, but is the obligation of an affiliated company.  The other tax lien is for $72,287.  This debt, according to Goldman \""relates to a 10 year use tax audit that was settled when I was an off[ic]er of Marco Polo Network, Inc.\""  Goldman states that each of the tax liens have been satisfied and are no longer outstanding.  There is a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding concerning Marco Polo Capital Markets, LLC, a company of which Goldman was the CFO and a Director.  On February 3, 2015, the RICE Section sent a letter to IDFC, requesting additional information regarding the Application.  A response was due before February 28, 2015, which was a Saturday.  Goldman and IDFC failed to respond to attempts by the RICE Section to contact him for additional information concerning his application.  The RICE Section received no response from IDFC or Goldman to its inquiry letter by Friday, February 27, 2015.  On February 27, 2015, an administrative complaint was filed to deny Goldman's broker-dealer agent registration.  Contemporaneous with the issuance of this Undertakings and Representations and Consent to Entry of Order, Goldman submitted an offer of settlement concerning the administrative complaint.  Review of the foregoing has moved the Division to place conditions on Goldman's registration as an agent of IDFC.  On May 23, 2016, the RICE Section received a signed Offer of Settlement, offering to settle the administrative action brought against Goldman. In the Offer, Goldman agreed to submit complete applications for registration and to respond promptly to requests for additional information; an administrative fine of $2,500, and to comply with specified undertakings and representations. On that same date, the RICE Section received a signed Undertakings and Representations and Consent to Entry of Order. Consent Orders for each of these documents were issued and filed on May 24, 2016."",
