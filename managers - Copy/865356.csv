  ""Allegations"" : ""In late January and early February, 2020, client submitted fully executed new account paperwork establishing a new account with Wellington which was opened on or about February 7, 2020.  Per instruction from client and her sister, assets previously held in sister's Wellington account (consisting of common and preferred stocks) were transferred into the client's new account.  Within weeks after the transfer of assets, the financial markets collapsed with the global spread of the coronavirus.  After the sharp drop, on March 16 and then March 30, 2020, the client emailed the firm and the registered representative denying the opening of the new account (and, in fact, denying any client relationship) and demanding that the securities be transferred back to the sister's account at  the higher value existing before the market turmoil.  In so claiming, the client alleged that the new account was never opened or that if opened, the holdings should have been immediately sold, without offering any foundation or basis for such contention.  The client seeks damages consisting of the difference in value of the holdings prior to the transfer and their current value."",
