  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I DENY THE ALLEGATIONS AND EVEN THOUGH THIS MATTER WAS SETTLED, I DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ANY LIABILITY OR ADMISSION OF WRONG DOING ON MY PART WHAT SO EVER. FOR OVER 15 YEARS, THIS CLIENT ALWAYS RECEIVED A SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNT ON RESTRICTED, SECTION 16 EQUITY TRANSACTIONS. APPARENTLY, THE CLIENT MADE THE ASSUMPTION THAT HIS NON-SECTION 16 TRANSACTIONS WOULD BE CHARGED AT THE SAME DEEPLY DISCOUNTED RATE, WHICH WAS NEVER PART OF OUR AGREEMENT. IN FACT, THIS CLIENT AGREED TO AND SIGNED A 10B51 PLAN WITH A STATED COMMISSION(THOUGH STILL DEEPLY DISCOUNTED) THAT WAS 2.5 TIMES HIGHER THAN THE COMMISSION RATE HE FELT HE WAS DUE. UBS RESOLVED THIS ISSUE STRICTLY AS A BUSINESS DECISION TO AVOID POSSIBLE ARBITRATION. I WAS NOT ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE ANY MONIES TOWARD THE SETTLEMENT OF THIS MATTER.""
