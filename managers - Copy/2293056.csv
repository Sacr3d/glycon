  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE FIRM FOUND THAT THE REPLACEMENT OF THE CLIENT'S TSA IN JUNE 2002 WAS SUITABLE FOR THE CLIENT GIVEN HER INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.  THE FIRM ALSO FOUND THAT TERMS OF THE NEW ANNUITY, IN RESPECT TO SURRENDER CHARGES, HAD BEEN MISREPRESENTED TO THE CLIENT.  THE FIRM OFFERED THE CLIENT THE ABILITY TO WITHDRAW $1,000 MONTHLY FROM HER CURRENT TSA FREE OF SURRENDER CHARGE WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE CLIENT'S EXPECTATIONS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, AND ALSO THE REIMBURSEMENT OF SURRENDER CHARGES ALREADY INCURRED.  THE CLIENT, HOWEVER, REFUSED THE FIRM'S OFFER AND THE MATTER WAS CLOSED. THE CLIENT HAS ACCEPTED THE FIRM'S OFFER AFTER ELECTING TO REVISIT THE ISSUE SIX MONTHS AFTER ITS INITIAL RESOLUTION.""
