  ""Broker Comment"" : ""DANIEL MARTINEZ \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t07/27/2007 829 RAYMOND ST SE PALM BAY, FL 32907      TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:  I (DANIEL MARTINEZ) AM PROVIDING WRITTEN CORRESPONDENCE IN REGARDS TO THE DISCREPANCY THAT WAS DISCLOSED IN THE SF SECURITIES APPLICATION.  THE DISCREPANCY CONSISTS OF A CRIMINAL CHARGE THAT WAS ISSUED IN 2000 FOR FRAUDULENT USE OF A CREDIT CARD, WHERE AJUDIFICATION WAS WITHHELD TO THE BEST OF MY UNDERSTANDING WITH NO CONVICTION VIA THE PRETRIAL INTERVENTION PROGRAM.  I CAN FORWARD SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION BY MEANS OF PUBLIC RECORDS WHICH INDICATES THAT ALL REQUISITIONS (RESTITUTION, COMMUNITY SERVICE, & PROBATION) FOR SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM WERE ACCOMPLISHED TO AVOID CONVICTION.  AGAIN I HAVE ATTACHED ALL CORRESPONDENCE IN REGARDS TO MATTER IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE OF FLORIDA.  BELOW I AM PROVIDING A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PAST INCIDENT WHICH I REMORSEFULLY REGRET.    IN JUNE OF 2000, I WAS EMPLOYED AT A RESTAURANT AND BAR.  APPARENTLY LATER THAT EVENING A BARTENDER, WHO ALSO EMPLOYED AT THE SAME LOCATION AS ME, INVITED ME OUT FOR A COUPLE OF DRINKS AFTER WORK.  ONCE WE HAD A COUPLE OF DRINKS AT A  LOCAL RESTAURANT THE BARTENDER SUGGESTED THAT HE PAY THE BILL, IT WAS NOT UNTIL THAT POINT IN TIME THAT HE INDICATED THAT HE ACQUIRED A CREDIT CARD WHICH HE CLAIMED WAS LEFT AT OUR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT.  AFTERWARDS WE HAD GONE TO DINER FOR A LATE DINNER WHERE THE BARTENDER PROCEEDED TO CONDUCT ANOTHER TRANSACTION WITH THE CARD, INEBRIATED I ASSISTED IN THE UTILIZATION OF THE CARD.  SUBSEQUENTLY SEVERAL TRANSACTIONS WERE CONDUCTED WITHOUT MY PRESENCE OR KNOWLEDGE.  AGAIN I REMORSEFULLY REGRET BEING INVOLVED WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL ON THAT EVENING; IN FACT I REGRET EVER SHARING MY FRIENDSHIP WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL.  I TRULY FEEL THAT IT WAS A MATTER OF GUILT BY ASSOCIATION.  IN ADDITION TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN SEVERAL CRIMINAL INCIDENTS SINCE THEN.  THEREAFTER WE WERE BOTH CHARGED FOR FRAUDULENT US""
