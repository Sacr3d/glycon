IN THE CLIENT'S OWN WORDS, \""THAT CORRESPONDANCE WAS USED IN A MANNER NOT INTENDED BY THE FIRM AND NASD, IT WAS NOT A COMPLAINT AND IS NOT A COMPLAINT & I DO NOT WISH TO SEEK ANY DAMAGES.  FURTHER, IT IS MY WISH THAT THIS NOT BECOME PART OF THE DECKERS' PROFESSIONAL RECORD.  IF I WANTED TO COMPLAIN, I WOULD HAVE HAD A LETTER COME FROM AN ATTORNEY AND SENT IT TO MANAGEMENT.  THE LACK OF PRIVACY WITH REGARD TO CORRESPONDANCE BETWEEN AN ADVISOR AND CLIENT CONCERNS ME.\""  THE CLIENT HAS MADE HIS OPINION KNOWN ON TAPE AND IN WRITTEN CORRESPONDANCE.  THE CLIENT FINDS IT INTERESTING THAT IN A MATTER SUCH AS THIS, NEIGHER THE FIRM NOR NASD HAVE CONTACTED HIM, YET THEY ARE WILLING TO PLACE AN UNNECCESARY MARK ON THE RECORDS TO TWO TRUSTED ADVISORS.""
