  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The criminal disclosure on my U-4 resulted from interactions with my doctor during medical treatment.  Over the last several years I have had two [REDACTED] surgeries, struggled with [REDACTED], and I have been battling [REDACTED]. One of the doctors treating me with these issues, a surgeon and acquaintance, belonged to the same golf club I did. I have always respected, adhered to, and been influenced by the judgment of medical doctors. On several occasions over the course of my treatment, the surgeon asked if I would give him a few of my prescription pain medication (hydrocodone). I complied with his requests because I trusted his judgment and I was led to believe that he may have been having an issue with his own pain on those specific instances. I viewed him as and friend and he was my doctor and I was just trying to help him with a pain he said he had. Unfortunately, I did not think about the fact that I was giving away something that was prescribed only to me and that doing so was a violation of the law.  To my surprise, the surgeon had a severe addiction to opioids where he was involving multiple patients, where he would provide them with a prescription and then ask for some pills back to treat his pain. Ultimately, a case was brought against the surgeon in Oklahoma state court and I provided the state sworn statements relating to the doctor and my involvement with him. Federal authorities took over the case and charged me, along with several others who had given the doctor pain pills, with conspiracy to distribute hydrocodone and oxycodone. I met with my attorney and the prosecuting attorney about my involvement. Given the facts and circumstances of the case, I was offered a plea bargain that would drop the original charges and was charged with one count of \""possession of a controlled substance.\"" I am not only sorry but embarrassed for my poor judgement in this matter.""
