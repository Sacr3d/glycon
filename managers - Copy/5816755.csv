  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The customer received multiple disclosures regarding her annuity surrender schedule and her investment objectives did not include current income.   Client was understanding and receptive of investment options which we went over several times.  Client admitted it was the right investment for her when she made the decision and was grateful for the help but changed her mind 2 months later.  Even though everything was compliant--I offered to assist with far beyond traditional methods to grant an exception and we agreed to keep active communication on progress.  We were making good progress to fulfill request on an exception basis--Unfortunately another party (friend of the client) reached out to me with hostile demands and verbiage.  Due to my uncertainty of the influence from this party on the client, I had to cancel progress on fulfilling client request.  Additionally, this claim has no merit due to me not being active advisor on her account near or at the time of this complaint.  I took a promotion in a different geographical region of the company shortly after I helped client with investment and introduced client to covering adviser so that she  may make any changes during her 2 month free look period effortlessly.  Multiple investment options were presented over several meetings and client received multiple disclosures both documented and verbally.  Thank you.""
