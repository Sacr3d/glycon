THE POLICY WAS DATED AUGUST 3RD, 2000 WITH SUBSEQUENT REVIEWS WITH THE CLIENT EACH YEAR. AS PART OF ONE OF THE REVIEWS, A MEMO WAS DRAFTED AT THE REQUEST OF THE INSURED TO BE GIVEN TO HIS WIFE SO THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT BENEFITS SHE WOULD RECEIVE AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PAYMENTS. THE CLIENT UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED WITH THE MEMO.  THERE WERE FURTHER ALLEGATIONS THAT THE BENEFITS WERE NOT BEING KEPT UP WITH THE STATED AMOUNTS, YET THE CLIENT DECLINED SOME OF THE COVERAGE TO KEEP PACE WITH HIS CONTRACT.  FURTHER, THE ALLEGATIONS WERE NOT CONSITENT WITH THE INTENT OF WHY THE PERMANENT INSURANCE WAS PURCHASED BY THE CLIENT AS THE CLIENT WAS GIVEN TWO ALTERNATIVES, TERM AND THE PURCHASED PERMANENT INSURANCE. AS THE CLIENT DESIRED TO HAVE THE OPTION TO HAVE POST EMPLOYMENT LIFE INSURANCE, THE PERMANENT WAS PURCHASED DUE TO THE EFFIECENT NATURE OF THE PREMIUM PAYMENTS.  FINALLY, THERE WERE ALLEGATIONS THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY IN THEMSELVES DID A POOR JOB DISCLOSING WHICH THE AGENT HAS NO CONTROL OVER HOW THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO DISCLOSE AND FILE THEIR PRODUCTS.  THE COMPLAINT IS REQUESTING THAT SURRENDER CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCTION OF COVERAGE (THEY WANT TO KEEP THE INSURANCE)SHOULD BE WAIVED."",
