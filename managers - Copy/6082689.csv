  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON JANUARY 10TH, 2014, I TRAVELED TO PHILADELPHIA TO HAVE A MEETING WITH AN ALUMNI OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. THAT WEEKEND WE PLANNED ON TOURING THE WHARTON SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AND ALSO THE U PENN LAW SCHOOL. FRIDAY NIGHT I WAS IN A MINOR CAR ACCIDENT AND THE BOYFRIEND OF THE WOMAN I WAS IN THE ACCIDENT WITH WAS REALLY RUDE AND CAUSED ISSUES. HE DEMANDED TO SEE MY LICENSE EVEN AFTER I EXCHANGED INFORMATION WITH HIS GIRL FRIEND AND I REFUSED TO GIVE IT TO HIM. I AM FROM VIRGINIA AND WE HAVE AN OPEN CARRY GUN LAW HERE. IN VIRGINIA A PERSON WHO LEGALLY PURCHASES A GUN DOES NOT HAVE TO OWN A CARRY PERMIT. IF A PERSON DOES HAVE HIS OR HER GUN IN THEIR VEHICLE IT HAS TO BE IN CLEAR VIEW AND NOT CONCEALED. THAT WAS MY MINDSET WHEN I TRAVELED TO PENNSYLVANIA, ESPECIALLY SINCE PA AND VA ARE COMMONWEALTH STATES. I HAD MY GUN ON THE FLOOR OF THE PASSENGER SIDE AND IT WAS UNLOADED. I DIDNT HIDE IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BE BREAKING THE LAW BY CONCEALING OR HIDING IT. WELL BECAUSE I UPSET THE BOYFRIEND BY NOT GIVING HIM MY LICENSE HE CALLED THE POLICE AND TOLD THEM I HAD A GUN. ONCE AGAIN, AS REPORTED IN THE POLICE REPORT I DIDNT PULL OUT THE GUN, REACH FOR THE GUN OR COMMUNICATE ANY THREATS. I PATIENTLY WAITED FOR THE POLICE TO ARRIVE TO SHOW THEM MY DRIVER'S LICENSE AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED I WAS ARRESTED FOR NOT HAVING A PERMIT TO CARRY IN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA. I WAS POLITE AND RESPECTFUL TO EVERYONE INVOLVED INCLUDING THE POLICE BUT BECAUSE I DIDNT HAVE A PERMIT TO CARRY IN PHILADELPHIA I WAS BOOKED AND INITIALLY CHARGED WITH A CLASS 3 FELONY. HOWEVER AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF REVIEWING MY BACKGROUND AND GATHERING INFORMATION ON MY CHARACTER FROM VARIOUS RELIABLE SOURCES THE DA DECIDED NOT CONVICT ME OF A FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR.""
