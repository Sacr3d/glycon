  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MR. SZTORC WAS A TRADER IN FOREIGN SECURITIES FOR FURMAN SELZ'S PROPRIETARY ACCOUNT.  IN A REVIEW OF HIS TRADING, THE FIRM FOUND THAT MR. SZTORC HAD NOT MARKED TO MARKET MORE THAN A MAJORITY OF HIS POSITIONS.  HAD THEY BEEN SO MARKED THE ACCOUNTS TRADING PROFIT TO THE DATE OF THE REVIEW, WHILE REMAINING SUBSTANTIALLY PROFITABLE, WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $1,800,000.  ADDITIONALLY, MR. SZTORC SERVICED TWO ACCOUNTS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO TRADED IN FOREIGN SECURITIES, AT TIMES WITH THE FIRM'S PROPRIETARY ACCOUNT.  ALL OF THE TRADES OF THESE TWO ACCOUNTS WERE PROFITABLE TO THE INDIVIDUALS, EXCEPT SEVERAL WHICH HAD NEITHER GAIN NOR LOSS.  BECAUSE THE ACCOUNTS DID NOT SHARE MR. SZTORC'S FAMILY NAME, FURMAN SELZ WAS UNAWARE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE RELATED TO HIM BY MARRIAGE.""
