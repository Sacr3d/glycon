THE CAR COMPANY CLAIMED IT WAS MY NEGLIGENCE THAT I CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE CAR WITH THE INDICATOR LIGHT ON. THEY CLAIMED THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE. THE INSURANCE WOULD NOT COVER IT BECAUSE THE CAR WAS UNDER 30 DAYS AND WANTED THE DEALERSHIP TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.  I DID NOT HAVE FUNDS TO TAKE THEM BOTH TO COURT TO GET IT RESOLVED AND THE LEASING COMPANY WAS AWARDED A JUDGMENT. IN 2002 I MET WITH THEIR ATTORNEYS AND SETTLED THE CASZE FOR $15,000.00, PAID TO THEM BY BANK CHECK. THEY ASSURED ME IT WOULD COME OFF MY CREDIT WITHIN A YEAR. BOTH THE DEALERSHIP AND THE LEASING COMPANY ARE NO LONGER IN BUSINESS.""
