  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CIRCUMSTANCES REARDING THE INCIDENT ON 6/24/1996 WERE AS FOLLOWS:  I WAS PARTICIPATING IN SOME WATER ACTIVITIES IN THE TOWN OF COHASSET, MA ON THE ABOVE DATE WHEN AN ALTERCATION BETWEEN A FEW INDIVIDUALS TURNED TOWARDS ALL THAT WERE OBSERVING.  WHILE TRYING TO LEAVE THE SCENE I WAS APPROACHED BY 5 INDIVIDUALS, ALL OF WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE WHO STATED THAT I WAS NOT GONG ANYWHERE.  SEEING THE SITUATION I WAS FACED WITH, AND MY PROXIMITY TO THE WATER WHICH PREVENTED AN ESCAPE I WAS FORCED TO USE PEPPER SPRAY IN MY DEFENSE ON ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS.  I CARRIED THE PEPPER SPRAY FOR PERSONAL PROTECTION AND HELD THE PROPER FID CARD AS REQUIRED BY THE COMMONEWEALTH OF MA.  THE OVER SPRAY CARRIED AND WAS INGESTED BY ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS BLOCKING MY ABILITY TO LEAVE.  DURING THE CHAOTIC SCENE THE POLICE WERE CALLED AND I WAS ARRESTED FOR MY ACTIONS.  THESE CHARGES WERE DISMISSED AND I HAVE LEARNED A VERY VALUABLE LESSON FROM THIS INCIDENT. I LOOK FORWARD TO PUTTING THIS INCIDENT BEHIND ME.""
