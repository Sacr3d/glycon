On August 13, 2020, FINRA made a preliminary determination to recommend that disciplinary action be brought against Suzanne Capellini alleging violations of FINRA Rules 8210 and 2010 in that she provided false or misleading information to FINRA in response to three FINRA Rule 8210 requests from the Office of Fraud Detection and Market Intelligence."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I HAVE FILED, THROUGH MY LEGAL COUNSEL, A DETAILED RESPONSE TO FINRA ENFORCEMENT'S PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION WHICH EXPLAINS WHY MY CONDUCT WAS, AT ALL TIMES, LAWFUL AND CONSISTENT WITH JUST AND EQUITABLE PRINCIPLES OF TRADE. UNFORTUNATELY, MY EMPLOYER OF 35 YEARS (FIRST MANHATTAN CO.) AND FINRA ENFORCEMENT HAVE BEEN UNDULY INFLUENCED BY THE INCORRECT AND BIASED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF FIRST MANHATTAN CO'S OUTSIDE COUNSEL. IF I AM CHARGED WITH VIOLATIONS OF FINRA RULES, I INTEND TO PRESENT MY CASE TO A FINRA DISCIPLINARY PANEL AND AM CONFIDENT THAT A PANEL OF REASONABLE AND FAIR INDIVIDUALS WILL VINDICATE ME OF ANY ALLEGED WRONGDOING.""
