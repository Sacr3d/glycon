WHEN THE VALUE OF THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT DECLINED BY LESS THAN 2%, THE CUSTOMER ISSUED HIS COMPLAINT TO PACIFIC LIFE, CLAIMING THAT I HAD ASSURED HIM THERE WAS NO RISK IN REGARD TO THIS INVESTMENT-WHICH IS FALSE.  CUSTOMER HAD SIGNED NUMEROUS DISCLOSURES STATING THE RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT AND THAT IT WAS NOT INSURED BY THE GOVERNMENT OR ANY BANK. ""
