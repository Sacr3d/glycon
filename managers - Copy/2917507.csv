  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON REVIEW OF LIMITED INFORMATION I BELIEVE THE INVESTMENT WAS MADE IN EARLY 2000.  WHILE THE DETAILS HAVE FADED WITH TIME I RELY ON MY COMMITMENT TO PROCESS TO RECOUNT THE EVENTS OF THIS TRANSACTION.  THE PROCESS OF WHICH I SPEAK INCLUDES - CLIENT DISCOVERY THROUGH INTERVIEW, EDUCATION, AND PRESENTATION OF SOLUTIONS.  IN ALL INTERVIEWS, EDUCATION INCLUDED A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF CLIENT INVESTABLE ASSETS, LABELING ASSETS AS - IMMEDIATE CASH; SHORT-TERM; AND LONG-TERM TO IDENTIFY THE APPROPRIATE VEHICLE FOR EACH.              WHAT I RECALL IS THAT [CUSTOMERS] WERE FOCUSED ON GROWING RETIREMENT ASSETS WITH OPPORTUNITY TO TURN THAT RETIREMENT INTO STREAM OF INCOME. WE DISCUSSED MARKET PARTICIPATION AND WE ALL AGREED THE VARIABLE ANNUITY WAS THE BEST SOLUTION.  I BELIEVE THE PROBLEM WAS MORE A FUNCTION OF THE ABSENCE OF A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, AND LESS THE WRONG FINANCIAL SOLUTION.  THE COMPLAINT CAME IN 2004 AFTER A YEAR OF MARKET VOLATILITY, COUPLED WITH THE UNCERTAINTY BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE SALE OF COMPASS BANK.  INVEST WAS NOT THE BROKERAGE PLATFORM FOR THE ACQUIRING BANK.  INVESTORS WERE LEFT WITH A 1-800# AS RESOURCE FOR ADVISE.""
