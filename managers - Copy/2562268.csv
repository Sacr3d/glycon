  ""Broker Comment"" : ""REP'S STATEMENT:I FIRST RECOMMENDED THE FIRST AMERICAN FUNDS WITH THE \""A\"" SHARE CLASS TO CLIENT.  I USED THE PROSPECTUS TO REVIEW THE OPERATING EXPENSES WITH SALES CHARGES ON ALL CLASSES WITH CLIENT.  CLIENT REFUSED TO PAY THE INITIAL CHARGE ON \""A\"" SHARES.  I STRONGLY ADVISED THE CLIENT TO FOCUS ON THE LONG-TERM EXPENSES.  CLIENT THANKED ME FOR SHOWING HIM THE CHARGES AND EXPENSES BUT INSISTED NOT TO PURCHASE THE CLASS \""A\"" SHARE.  BASED ON THE CLIENT'S REFUSAL TO PURCHASE THE \""A\"" SHARE, I THEN OFFERED THE \""B\"" SHARES.  CLIENT SIGNED INVESTMENT BREAKPOINT LETTERS.  THE RATIONAL TO INVEST IN 3 DIFFERENT MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES WAS BASED ON CLIENT INSTRUCTIONS.  CLIENT DID NOT WANT 1 MUTUAL FUND COMPANY INVESTING HIS IRA.  CLIENT WANTED A LIST OF MUTUAL FUNDS BASED ON THE RECOMMENDED ASSET ALLOCATION FOR LARGE CAP VALUE & GROWTH, MID CAP VALUE & GROWTH, SMALL CAP VALUE & GROWTH AND BOND FUND.  CLIENT THEN DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE COLUMBIA, FIRST AMERICAN AND MFS FUNDS. THIS EVENT IS NO LONGER REPORTABLE.""
