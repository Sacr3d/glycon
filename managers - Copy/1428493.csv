  ""Broker Comment"" : ""EQUITABLE CANCELLED THE CLIENTS POLICY AND REFUNDED THE PREMIUMS PAID BY THE CLIENT. THE LOSS TO THE FIRM WAS $9,619.46. I DENY ANY ALLEGED MISREPRESENTATION OR FAILURE TO DISCLOSE PERTINENT INFORMATION TO CUSTOMER. ALTHOUGH HE COMPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCT HE PURCHASED, HIS COMPLAINT WAS A TRANSPARENT ATTEMPT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE POLICY HE KNOWINGLY PURCHASED BECAUSE HE CHANGED HIS MIND. THE CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH THE POLICY WAS PURCHASED AND THE LENGHT OF TIME HE OWNED IT AND PAID AGAINST IT MAKES IT IMPOSIBBLE FOR HIM TO HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD ANY MATERIAL CHARACTERISTIC OF IT. THE DECISION TO RESCIND THE TRANSACTION AND REFUND THE CLIENT'S PREMIUM PAYMENTS WAS MADE BY EQUITABLE FOR MARKETING AND CLIENT RELATION PURPOSES. WHILE I DISAGREE WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE COMPLAINT, I BELIEVE THE DECISION TO RESCIND AND REFUND WAS PRUDENT FROM A CLIENT RELATIONS STANDPOINT. I DID NOT CONTRIBUTE FINANCIALLY TO THE RESOLUTION OF THIS DISPUTE, OTHER TAN TO FORFEIT COMMISSIONS EARNED.""
