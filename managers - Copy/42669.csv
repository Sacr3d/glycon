  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN MID 1996 I CONTACTED OUR NASD EXAMINER MATT HUGHES AND TOLD HIM THAT DUE TO THE VERY LIMITED SCOPE OF OUR FIRM (SMALLER TECHNOLOGY EQUITIES) I WAS HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE NEW CONTINUING ED. PROGRAM.  HE HAD A FEW SUGGESTIONS BUT SAID NOT TO WORRY AS THE NASD APPROACH WAS TO GIVE US A PASS ON THIS THROUGH THE FIRS AUDIT AFTER THE NEW PROGRAM, AND THAT THE STAFF AUDITORS WOULD SHOW ME WHAT THEY WANTED.  UNFORTUNATELY, I ACCEPTED THIS AS GOOD ADVICE AND WAITED FOR THE AUDITORS TO ARRIVE.  IN 1997 IN OUR OPENING MEETING I INFORMED THE AUDITORS WHAT I HAD DONE AND THAT I LOOKED FORWARD TO THEIR HELP.""
