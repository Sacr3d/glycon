  ""Broker Comment"" : ""At the peak of the housing market I had made a poor decision to buy real estate.  My wife and I were just starting a family and my renters moved out of the rental property leaving me in a cash outflow position that I unfortunately could not get out of.  The value of the property sank dramatically and with a newborn son I was not able to support my family and support the additional expenses on the condo.  Thankfully Bank of America settled the short sale and the property was discharged and satisfied.  The short sale has since been removed off of my credit report completely.""
