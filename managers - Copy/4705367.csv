  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE FELONY CHARGE IN 2001 WAS ACTUALLY A LACK OF FOLLOWING UP BY THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA. THEY HAD REQUESTED ORIGINALLY THAT COLORADO (WHERE I WAS LIVING AT THE TIME) SUSPEND MY LICENSE UNTIL BACK CHILD SUPPORT WAS PAID IN FULL. I THEN GOT THE BACK CHILD SUPPORT COMPLETELY PAID, BUT SOUTH DAKOTA DID NOT INFORM COLORADO THAT MY DEBT HAD BEEN SETTLED. COLORADO, AS A STATE LAW (FELONY), CALLED FUGITIVE OF JUSTICE THAT APPLIES TO ANYONE WHO OWES CHILD SUPPORT IN ANOTHER STATE IN THE US. FROM THEIR (COLORADO'S) RECORDS I STILL OWED MONEY IN SOUTH DAKOTA AND THEREFORE CHARGED WITH A FELONY THAT, WHEN THEY FINALLY CONTACTED SOUTH DAKOTA AND FOUND THAT MY DEBT HAD BEEN PAID, WAS DROPPED. I WAS NOT CONVICTED OF ANYTHING, NOR DID I PLEAD NO CONTEST TO ANYTHING. ONCE THE RECORDS WERE UPDATED, THE CHARGES WERE DROPPED AND I WAS RELEASED.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE MISDEMEANOR CHARGE IN 1997 FOR IMPERSONATION; I WAS BACK HOME IN RAPID CITY AND WE WERE OUT IN THE BLACK HILLS AT A BON FIRE. POLICE BROKE UP THE \""EVENT\"", SO I LEFT AND BEGAN WALKING HOME. ON MY WAY HOME A POLICE OFFICER PULLED OVER AND BEGAN TO QUESTION ME ABOUT THE EVENT. KNOWING THAT I RECENTLY HAD AN ALCOHOL OFFENSE IN SIOUX FALLS, I DID NOT WANT TO GIVE HIM MY NAME SO I MADE ONE UP. OBVIOUSLY HE EVENTUALLY FOUND OUT WHO I WAS AND THEY ADDED IMPERSONATION TO MY CHARGE. THE CHARGE WAS DROPPED WHEN IT WAS REALIZED THE REASON I HAD GIVEN A FALSE NAME. I DID NOT ENTER A PLEA FOR THIS CHARGE EITHER, IT WAS SIMPLY DROPPED. THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY A POOR CHOICE ON MY PART AND NOTHING I WOULD EVER TRY AGAIN.""
