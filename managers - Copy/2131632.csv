  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CLIENT PURCHASED INVESTMENTS BASED ON HER INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISK TOLERANCE AND TIME HORIZON. AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE THE INVESTMENTS WERE SOUND AND APPROPRIATE. A BID TO SELL LEHMAN NOTE WAS PROVIDED TO THE CLIENT ON 9/14/2007 ON WHICH THE CLIENT DECLINED TO SELL.  IN OCTOBER 2007, THE CLIENT TRANSFERRED HER ACCOUNT TO ANOTHER FIRM AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF A PERSONAL FRIEND.  WHEN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF LEHMAN BROTHERS RAISED CONCERNS, MY CURRENT CLIENTS SOLD THEIR POSITIONS IN APRIL 2008, TOOK PROFITS AND BENEFITED FROM THEIR INVESTMENTS. I DENY ALL THE ALLEGATIONS AS STATED BY THE COMPLAINANT.  REGARDING THIS SETTLEMENT, WHICH WAS SETTLED OUTSIDE THE ARBITRATION FORUM, THIS SETTLEMENT DOES NOT REFLECT ANY ACKNOWLEDGMENT OR ADMISSION OF ANY LIABILITY OR MISCONDUCT ON MY PART WHATSOEVER AND I WAS READY AND WILLING TO TESTIFY AS TO MY ACTIONS AND MY HANDLING OF THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNT.  I FELT THAT THE CLIENT'S CLAIM WAS UNWARRANTED.  HOWEVER, THE FIRM, WHO ALSO DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS, RESOLVED THIS ISSUE STRICTLY TO AVOID THE UNCERTAINTIES AND POTENTIAL COST OF THE ARBITRATION PROCESS AND HEARING.  FINALLY, I DID NOT, NOR WAS I ASKED TO PERSONALLY CONTRIBUTE ANY AMOUNT TOWARDS THE SETTLEMENT OF THIS CASE.""
