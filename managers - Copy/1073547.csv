  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE COMPANY ADJUSTED THE POLICY SO THAT NO FURTHER OUT OF POCKET PREMIUMS WILL BE REQUIRED (ESTIMATED SETTLEMENT COST:  $10,349.00). THIS MATTER IS BEING REPORTED CONSISTENT WITH NASDR RULES PERTAINING TO THE REPORTING OD CERTAIN CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF $10,000 OR MORE. THE COMPANY BY THIS FILING MAKES NO ALLEGATIONS REGARDING THE ACTIONS OF THE REPRESENTATIVE.  I AM SIGNING THEIR ONLY BECAUSE IT IS MANDATORY.  THE INFORMATION GIVEN BY MR. & MRS. [CUSTOMER] IS UNTRUE AND INCONSISTENT WITH THE ACTUAL FACTS.  ESPECIALLY SINCE MR. [CUSTOMER] BORROWED MONEY FROM ALL HIS INSURANCE POLICIES FOR AN INVESTMENT VENTURE.  AGAINST MY ADVISE ABOUT BORROWING TO RE INVEST WAS A BAD IDEA.  THE 11 YRS OF PAYMENTS BEFORE INTERNAL BUNDS WOULD PAY PREMIUMS WERE CLEARLY EXPLAINED AS BASED ON THEIR CURRENT ASSUMPTIOUS.""
