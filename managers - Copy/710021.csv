  ""Broker Comment"" : ""FROM OUR FIRST MEETING 17.5 YEARS AGO, CUSTOMER EXPRESSED HER STRONG DESIRE TO PROVIDE A GENEROUS RETIREMENT INCOME FOR HER DAUGHTER, LISA. ONCE WE ASCERTAINED THAT CUSTOMER HAD SUFFICIENT INCOME AND CAPITAL RESERVES FOR HERSELF, AND WHEN CUSTOMER UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE ALSO HAD AN ESTATE TAX PROBLEM, AND WHEN SHE SAW HOW THE LIFE PREMIUMS WOULD BE PAID FROM ASSETS OUTSIDE OF HER RESERVES, CUSTOMER AGREED THAT THIS POLICY WAS APPROPRIATE, THE PREMIUM WAS AFFORDABLE AND WOULD NOT BE A FINANCIAL BURDEN TO HER IN ANYWAY. SHE WAS THRILLED THAT THIS WOULD HELP HER REACH HER GOAL OF PROVIDING A RETIREMENT INCOME FOR HER DAUGHTER, LISA, AND AN INHERITANCE TO HER GRANDCHILDREN. CUSTOMER HAD AN EXCESS INCOME FROM ACTUAL RETIREMENT INCOME SOURCES (AS OPPOSED TO INVESTMENTS) AT THE TIME OF THE INSURANCE PURCHASE. THE INSURANCE PREMIUMS WERE TO BE PAID INITIALLY FROM ANNUITIES OUTSIDE OF HER INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, SHE WAS NOT TAKING ANY INCOME FROM HER INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. CUSTOMER HAD EXCELLENT LONG TERM CARE COVERAGE TO PROTECT HER ASSETS FROM BEING CONSUMED IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT, [REDACTED] OR ILLNESS.""
