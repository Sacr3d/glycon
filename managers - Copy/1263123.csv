  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CUSTOMER'S ALLEGATIONS ARE ENTIRELY WITHOUT MERIT AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACTS.  DURING SEVERAL PHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CLIENT, WE DISCUSSED MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR HIM AS WELL AS HIS CONCERNS ABOUT THE MARKET AT LENGTH.  THE CUSTOMER DECIDED TO SELL OFF ALMOST EVERYTHING IN THE ACCOUNT AND GAVE ORDERS TO SELL AGGRESSIVELY.  I FOLLOWED HIS ORDERS.   CONFIRMS WERE SENT TO HIM THAT WEEK.  I DID NOT HEAR FROM HIM AGAIN UNTIL MONTHS LATER WHEN HE REQUESTED SOME FUNDS BE MAILED TO HIM.  A FEW MONTHS WENT BY AND HE CALLED AND CLAIMED I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SOLD ALL OF THE INVESTMENTS IN THE ACCOUNT SIX MONTHS AGO AT OUR INITIAL CALL.  THE CUSTOMER  NEVER MADE SUCH REQUEST.  FURTHER THE DIFFERENCE IN THE ACCOUNT VALUE DUE TO MARKET FLUCTUATION OVER THESE SIX MONTHS WAS LESS THAN $3,000 AND NOT THE SIZABLE AMOUNT THAT HE CLAIMED, AS VERIFIED BY HIS ACCOUNT STATEMENTS.""
