  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CUSTOMER AND HIS SISTER INHERITED OVER $80 MILLION AND IN THE COURSE OF SIX YEARS SPENT NEARLY ALL OF IT AND ARE TRYING TO HOLD US RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR SPENDING. CUSTOMER REJECTED OUR ADVICE TO USE OUR RECOMMENDED PORTFOLIO. INSTEAD, CUSTOMER INSISTED ON CONCENTRATING THEIR INVESTMENTS INTO JUST THREE MODELS. WE HAD THEM SIGN DISCLAIMERS ON 12-12-2007 THAT WARNED THEM OF INCREASING VOLATILITY IF THEY JUST HAD THREE MODELS. JIM BLACK HAS NEVER HAD A COMPLAINT IN HIS 24 YEARS IN THE BUSINESS. THE RETIREMENT SOLUTION HAS NEVER HAD A COMPLAINT IN ITS HISTORY. AGAINST MY WISHES THE INSURANCE COMPANY SETTLED. I WANTED TO LET A COURT SEE THE TRUTH, BUT WHEN THE CLIENT OFFERED TO TAKE 10% OF WHAT THEY ALLEGEDLY LOST, THE INSURANCE COMPANY DECIDED THAT IS ABOUT WHAT LITIGATION WOULD COST AND AGREED EVEN THOUGH I ARGUED AGAINST IT.""
