I WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE BODY OF THE STATEMENT OF CLAIM AS THE CLIENT'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR AND THAT IS TRUE BUT THERE WERE NO ALLEGATIONS ALLEGED SPECIFICALLY AGAINST ME.  THERE WAS NEVER ANY CLAIM THAT I WAS IN ERROR OR THAT I DID ANYTHING WRONG.  CLIENT'S CONCERNS REFERENCE A STOCK CERTIFICATE THAT THEY REQUESTED TO BE SOLD, HOWEVER, THAT CERTIFICATE NEVER MADE TO ME OR INTO THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNT.  THIS WHOLE ISSUE WAS AN OPERATIONAL ERROR MADE AT MORGAN STANLEY AS THE CERTIFICATE WAS LOST BY THEIR MAILROOM/BACK OFFICE OPERATIONS.  IF THE STOCK CERTIFICATE HAD BEEN PLACED INTO THE ACCOUNT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLD.  I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CLIENT AND THEY REPEATEDLY STATED THEY DO NOT HOLD ME RESPONSIBLE AND ARE TAKING NO ACTION AGAINST ME AND REALIZE THAT I COULD NOT SELL STOCK IF IT WAS NOT DEPOSITED IN THE ACCOUNT.""
