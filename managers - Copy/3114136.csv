FITZGERALD HAD INACCURATELY REPORTED SALES ACTIVITY THAT THE ADVISOR MEASURES TO AWARD PERFORMANCE BONUSES, THEREBY EARNING A BONUS TO WHICH HE WAS NOT ENTITLED."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The Broker, Mr. Fitzgerald, resigned from the company in protest after the company falsely accused him of misreporting sales activity in order to receive a bonus.  In fact, the Broker had reported all his activity in good faith and earned the bonus he received.  The company threatened to bring FINRA arbitration, based on groundless accusations, to claw back the bonus, so the Broker commenced an arbitration to clear his name and retain the bonus.  After the arbitration, a panel of FINRA arbitrators agreed with the Broker and ruled that he should keep the bonus.  The arbitrators also ordered the company to pay the entire cost of the arbitration hearing sessions.  See FINRA Dispute Resolution Case No. 14-00831.""
