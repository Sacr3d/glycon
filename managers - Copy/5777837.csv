  ""Broker Comment"" : ""WHEN A NON-LICENSED BANKER HAD A CLIENT WHO ASKED ABOUT INVESTMENTS THEY WOULD COME PULL ME FROM MY OFFICE AND I WOULD SPEAK TO THAT CUSTOMER ABOUT DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND WHAT RETURNS THEY COULD GET ON THEIR FUNDS. THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR THAT WORKED OUT OF THAT BRANCH SAW THAT THE BANKERS WERE GETTING ME FOR HELP INSTEAD OF HERSELF AND GOT REALLY UPSET. SHE WANTED THE BANKERS TO REFER TO HER, NOT MYSELF SO SHE TOLD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE I WAS STEALING SALES CREDITS WHEN IN FACT I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB. CHASE TOOK HER SIDE AND TERMINATED ME.""
