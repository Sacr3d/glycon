  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS COMPLAINT RELATES TO A PRODUCT SOLD BY THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE WHEN SHE WAS EMPLOYED WITH TIAA-CREF INDIVIDUAL & INSTITUTIONAL SERVICES, LLC. THE CLIENT ALLEGES THAT I DID NOT DISCLOSE THE VARIABLE NATURE OF THE PRODUCT. THE CLIENT HAD TO STATE ON A RECORDED LINE THE ASSET ALLOCATION HE WANTED FOR THE INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY FOR THE APPLICATION TO PROCEED. PRIOR TO THE CALL, I THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED MARKET VOLATILITY WITH THE CLIENT TO ASSIST HIM IN MAKING THE ULTIMATE INVESTMENT DECISION AND THOROUGHLY DOCUMENTED THE CONVERSATION. THE CLIENT THEN CONTINUED TO INVEST IN THE PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL YEARS. DURING THAT TIME, WE HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ASSET ALLOCATION FOR OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT WERE PART OF HIS OVERALL PORTFOLIO. AT NO TIME COULD I HAVE MISREPRESENTED THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCT. THE WRITTEN COMPLAINT WAS CLOSED WITH NO ACTION DUE TO NO WRONGDOING ON MY PART. CLIENT THEN DECIDED TO PURSUE CIVIL LITIGATION.""
