  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I PURCHASED THE HOUSE AT THE PEAK OF HOUSING PRICES BEFORE THE 2008 CREDIT CRISIS (AND RESULTING REAL ESTATE PRICE DEFLATION).  WE MOVED FROM THE HOUSE AND WERE RENTING IT OUT BECAUSE IT WAS WORTH LESS THAN WE OWED.  I CONTACTED THE BANK TO SEE IF THEY WOULD APPROVE A SHORT SALE AND THEY QUICKLY APPROVED IT.  SO I SOLD THE HOUSE FOR LESS THAN IT WAS WORK AND THE BANK FORGAVE THE BALANCE OF THE MORTGAGE ABOUT THE SALE PRICE.""
