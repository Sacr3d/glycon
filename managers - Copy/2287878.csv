FROM AT LEAST APRIL 2006 THROUGH FEBRUARY 2011, BASED ON NONPUBLIC INFORMATION THAT THE LAWYER OBTAINED FROM HIS EMPLOYER, BAUER TRADED IN ADVANCE OF AT LEAST NINE PENDING MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS INVOLVING COMPANIES THAT WERE ADVISED BY THE LAWYER'S EMPLOYER, AND REALIZED OVER $30 MILLION IN ILL-GOTTEN GAINS.

THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT THE CORPORATE ATTORNEY AND BAUER DID NOT HAVE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER, BUT WERE LINKED ONLY THROUGH A MUTUAL FRIEND WHO ACTED AS A MIDDLEMAN TO FACILITATE THE ILLEGAL SCHEME.

THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT THE CORPORATE ATTORNEY ACCESSED INFORMATION ON 11 MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS INVOLVING THE LAW FIRM'S CLIENTS AND THEN TIPPED THE MIDDLEMAN.

THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT BAUER, THE CORPORATE ATTORNEY AND THE MIDDLEMAN DELIBERATELY STRUCTURED THEIR COMMUNICATIONS AND TRADING SO THAT THE CORPORATE ATTORNEY AND THE MIDDLEMAN COULD SHARE IN THE INSIDER TRADING PROCEEDS WHILE BAUER COULD ILLEGALLY TRADE AND PROFIT WITHOUT BEING CONNECTED TO THE CORPORATE ATTORNEY AS A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION.  BAUER WITHDREW CASH FROM HIS BANK ACCOUNTS AND KICKED BACK HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO THE MIDDLEMAN, WHO IN TURN DELIVERED AT LEAST $500,000 TO THE CORPORATE ATTORNEY FOR HIS ROLE IN THE SCHEME.
