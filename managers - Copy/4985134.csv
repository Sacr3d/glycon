  ""Firm Name"" : ""VALIC FINANCIAL ADVISORS, INC."",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Mr. Montemurro attempted to influence advisors' investment recommendations in order to maximize certain sales manager performance metrics."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I DISAGREE WITH THE ALLEGATIONS ON MY FORM U5. MY INTERVENTION IN THE INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS BEING MADE BY THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR UNDER MY SUPERVISION WAS AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT THE ADVISOR FROM ENGAGING IN IMPROPER SWITCHING OF CLIENT VARIABLE ANNUITY POLICIES IN ORDER TO INCREASE HIS INCOME, NOT TO MAXIMIZE PERFORMANCE METRICS. THE STATEMENT IS ALSO FALSE BECAUSE EVEN HAD I BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING THE IMPROPER ANNUITY SURRENDER, IT WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT - LET ALONE \""MAXIMIZE\"" ANY PERFORMANCE SALES METRICS. I ALERTED VALIC OF WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THIS FINANCIAL ADVISOR'S INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT, BUT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DISCHARGED BY THE COMPANY.""
