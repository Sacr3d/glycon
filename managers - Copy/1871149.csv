IN MY OPINION, THE CUSTOMER'S CLAIM WAS WITHOUT MERIT; SIMPLY NOT TRUE, AND I TOLD FIRST BANK NO TO PAY IT. THE BANK AGREED AND SENT A LETTER TO THE CUSTOMER REJECTING THE CLAIM.  THEY LATER DECIDED (AGAINST MY WISHES) TO PAY THE CLAIM IN FULL AND DID NOT ASK ME TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY WAY.  THE PAYMENT OF THE CLAIM WAS ENTIRELY THE BANK'S DECISION.  I THEREFORE DENY ANY PERSONAL WRONGDOING WITH RESPECT TO THE CUSTOMER'S CLAIM.""
