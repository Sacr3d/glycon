  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CLIENT WAS GIVEN $70K SETTLEMENT.  THE CLAIM WAS FAILURE TO DISCLOSE NATURE OF ANNUITY INVESTMENT.  HOWEVER, I WAS NOT ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING TO THE SETTLEMENT AS I WAS NOT FOUND TO BE IN ANY WAY RESPONSIBLE. IN EARLY 1988 I ACCOMPANIED A BROKER FROM PRU BACHE ON A SALES CALL.  THE CLIENT PURCHASED A SINGLE PREMIUM DEFERRED ANNUITY IN THE AMOUNT OF 10 MILLION DOLLARS.  THE CONTRACT WAS ISSUED BY PRUDENTIAL INS. CO. OF AMERICA. THE HUSBAND DIED ABOUT 2 WEEKS AFTER THE CONTRACT WAS PURCHASED. THE WIDOW (THE COMPLAINTANT) ALLEGES THAT GEORGE HEFNER, THE WRITING AGENT, SHOULD HAVE SOLD THEM A SINGLE PREMIUM WHOLE LIFE. NAMED IN COMPLAINT WERE PRU BACHE, PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY, GEORGE HEFNER AND IRA BARON.  I DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY COMPENSATION FOR THIS SALE. WHEN THE CASE WAS SETTLED, I WAS NOT FOUND TO BE RESPONSIBLE.""
