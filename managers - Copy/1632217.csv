CLAIM WAS BROUGHT BY THE NEPHEW OF THE INVESTOR AFTER THE DEATH OF THE INVESTOR AND TWO YEARS AFTER THE LAST TRADE WAS MADE IN THE ACCOUNT. THE NEPHEW WAS NEVER INVOLVED IN THE HANDLING OF THE INVESTMENTS.  THE INVESTOR WAS VERY EXPERIENCED, PERFORMED HIS OWN RESEARCH AND DIRECTED VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE TRADING IN THE ACCOUNT.  THIS WAS MY FIRST CUSTOMER COMPLAINT OF ANY KIND IN OVER EIGHT YEARS AS A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE.  I DENY ANY WRONGDOING IN THE HANDLING OF THIS ACCOUNT.""
