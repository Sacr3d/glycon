THE FIRM PAID CLAIMANT THE FULL AWARD ON 6/8/93. THE FIRM IS NOT REQUIRING THAT I CONTRIBUTE ANY PORTION OF THE AWARD AND HAS AGREED TO REIMBURSE ME FOR ATTORNEY FEES I HAVE SPENT ON MY OWN COUNSEL. [CUSTOMER'S] CLAIMS HAD NO LEGAL OR FACTUAL BASIS AND WERE MERELY AN ATTEMPT BY  A SPECULATOR TO MAKE HIS BROKER A QUARANTOR AGAINST LOSS. IN RESPONSE TO A MOTION FILED BY [CUSTOMER], THE ARBITRATORS DECLINED TO EXPLAIN THE CALCULATION OF DAMAGES. HOWEVER, IT APPEARS TO THE FIRM & TO ME THAT THE ARBITRATORS DID NOT FIND [CUSTOMER'S] TESTIMONY AT THE HEARING CONVINCING OR CREDIBLE AND WERE INSTEAD PERSUADED BY MY TESTIMONY, WHICH WAS THAT [CUSTOMER] AUTHORIZED ALL TRANSACTIONS IN HIS ACCOUNT.""
