  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Admin Release, 34-83602, IA Release 40-4954, Investment Company Act Release 40-33150 / July 6, 2018: The Securities and Exchange Commission (\""Commission\"") deems it appropriate that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be instituted against Michael Johnson (\""Respondent\"" or \""Johnson\"").  On the basis of this Order and Respondent's Offer, the Commission finds that this matter involves insider trading by Michael Johnson, a former registered representative, in advance of the November 17, 2015 public announcement that Airgas, Inc. (\""Airgas\"") had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Air Liquide, S.A. (\""Air Liquide\"") for approximately $10.3 billion, or $143 per share. In October and November of 2015, Johnson misappropriated material nonpublic information about the proposed acquisition from his relative (\""Individual A\""), a certified public accountant who was providing personal tax accounting services to a senior officer at Airgas with access to material nonpublic information (the \""Senior Officer\"") during the time of the merger negotiations. Johnson owed a duty of trust or confidence to Individual A and understood that the information obtained from Individual A was confidential and that he should not trade on it. However, in breach of a duty of trust or confidence owed to Individual A, Johnson misappropriated the information by purchasing shares of Airgas in advance of the public announcement of the merger. Johnson realized illegal profits of $88,699. By engaging in this conduct, Johnson willfully violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which prohibit fraudulent conduct in connection with the purchase or sale of securities."",
