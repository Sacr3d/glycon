  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS MATTER INVOLVES THE SALE OF AUCTION RATE SECURITIES (ARS). THE TRANSACTION(S) AT ISSUE TOOK PLACE BEFORE MID-FEBRUARY 2008, WHEN THE ARS MARKET SUFFERED WIDESPREAD AUCTION FAILURES AND ILLIQUIDITY. THE SALES REPRESENTATIVE DID NOT CAUSE, CONTRIBUTE OR HAVE ANY CONTROL WHATSOEVER OVER THESE MARKET EVENTS. THE FIRM REACHED AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN OF ITS REGULATORS, PURSUANT TO WHICH IT REPURCHASED ARS FOR THEIR FULL PAR VALUE FROM CERTAIN CLIENTS, INCLUDING THE INSTANT CLIENT, WHETHER THEY COMPLAINED OR NOT. THE SALES REPRESENTATIVE WAS NOT A PARTY TO THAT AGREEMENT, DID NOT MAKE ANY PAYMENT TO THE CLIENT, AND WAS NOT ASKED TO AND DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE REPURCHASE AMOUNT. THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT IN ITEM 11 ABOVE REFLECTS THE PAR VALUE OF THE REPURCHASED ARS, AS REQUIRED BY FINRA REGULATORY NOTICE 09-12. RE #6 ABOVE-NOT SPECIFIED BY CLIENT. MS. SWETONIC STATED THAT SHE DOES NOT RECALL THE SPECIFIC ORAL DISCLOSURES MADE TO THIS CLIENT, BUT THAT DURING THE TIME THAT THE CLIENT PURCHASED ITS ARS, IT WAS, AND STILL IS PART OF HER STANDARD PRACTICE TO INFORM CLIENTS OF THE STRUCTURE AND RISKS OF AUCTION RATE SECURITIES PRIOR TO THE CLIENTS PURCHASE OF THEM AND FREQUENTLY ON AN ONGOING BASIS. MS. SWETONIC STATED THAT SHE INFORMS CLIENTS THAT ARS ARE LONG-TERM SECURITIES THAT RESET THEIR RATES ON A SHORT TERM BASIS, TYPICALLY EVERY WEEK OR MONTH; THAT CLIENTS CAN BUY OR SELL, AT PAR, ONLY ON THE AUCTION DATE AND NO LIQUIDITY WILL BE PROVIDED BETWEEN AUCTIONS; AND FURTHER THAT IF THERE ARE MORE SELLERS THAN BUYERS, AN AUCTION COULD FAIL. MS. SWETONIC STATED THAT SHE INFORMS CLIENTS THAT THERE IS NO GUARANTEED \""PUT OPTION\"" WITH ARS AND THEY ARE NOT QUALIFIED FOR MONEY FUND PURCHASES. MS. SWETONIC STATED THAT SHE PROVIDES TO CLIENTS THE BAS ARS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT (WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED BY BAS FOR USE WITH ARS CLIENTS) WHICH EXPLAINS HOW ARS WORK AND PRESENTS THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ARS. IT IS MS. SWETONIC'S BELIEF THAT SHE DID NOT DEVIATE FROM HER STANDARD PRACTICE WITH THIS CLIENT.""
