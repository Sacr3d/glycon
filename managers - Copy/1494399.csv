  ""Allegations"" : ""[REDACTED] engaged the investment advisory services of TITAN Financial Partners, Inc. with her older sister (an existing TITAN client) in March 1999; she deposited approx. $44,000 into an IRA account.  Charles Schwab & Co. (\""Schwab\"") served as the custodian/broker-dealer for her IRA; Schwab sent [REDACTED] monthly statements listing all investment positions.  [REDACTED] communicated  to James Hickman (\""Hickman\"") her desire to have an investment portfolio similar to what her sister had been enjoying as a result of TITAN's efforts.  TITAN/Hickman had no reason to believe [REDACTED] was dissatisfied with the advisory services provided prior to the termination of the relationship.  Between Aug. 2000 and Mar. 2003 the broad equity market declined approximately 39% as represented by the NYSE Composite Index. [REDACTED] abandoned the long-term investment strategy involving the equity securities of quality publicly traded companies including some having the largest capitalizations in the world at that time.  [REDACTED] withdrew her IRA assets in Dec. 2002 near the equity market's bottom, closed her IRA account thus terminating relationship with TITAN.  On July 8, 2003 in a letter sent via her attorney, [REDACTED] alleged TITAN/Hickman were to blame for the decline in her IRA's value as a result of unspecified negligent acts or omissions by TITAN and investments made without her authority; [REDACTED] also alleged she had only wanted her money placed in guaranteed investments despite the fact Schwab had been mailing monthly account statements to her for almost four (4) years as well as Hickman's notes to the contrary transcribed following various communications with [REDACTED].  [REDACTED] initiated a civil action in June 2003 against TITAN/Hickman without TITAN/Hickman's knowledge - no service ever given; [REDACTED] abandoned same legal action and the matter was dismissed Non-Pros on Feb. 27, 2004. TITAN/Hickman deny allegations despite anything to the contrary."",
