  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE ARBITRATORS RENDERED A DECISION & CONCLUDED THAT RESPONDENTS [OTHER FIRM EMPLOYEE] & ENGERMAN ARE LIABLE & SHALL PAY 37,381.69 TO CLAIMANT, 60% TO BE PAID BY [OTHER FIRM EMPLOYEE] & 40% TO BE PAID BY ENGERMAN. JW CHARLES SETTLED THE CLAIM WITH THE CLAIMANT PRIOR TO THE AWARD [OTHER FIRM EMPLOYEE] & ENGERMAN MUST PAY INTEREST & FILING FEES. I HAD BEEN THE BROKE FOR THIS ACCOUNT SINCE 1983. SHORTLY AFTER I BECAME [CUSTOMER'S] BROKER, HE BECAME THE DENTIST FOR MY FAMILY & ME. THE ACCOUNT DID WELL FOR MANY YEARS, ALTHOUGH MORE RECENTLY, IT DID NOT DO WELL. DESPITE [CUSTOMER'S]  EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS THAT I WAS NOT AWARE OF (AS HIS OWN ATTORNEY MENTIONED IN THE CLAIM), THEY DID NOT INTERFERE WITH HIS UNDERSTANDING OF EACH ACTION TAKEN. THE FILING OF THIS ARBITRATION WAS A COMPLETE SURPRISE TO ME. I TOTALLY DENY ANY & ALL OF THE CLAIMS THAT ALLEGE WRONGDOING OF ANY KIND ON MY PART.""
