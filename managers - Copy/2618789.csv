  ""Allegations"" : ""FINRA RULE 2010, NASD RULE 2110, 2330: LOGAN ENGAGED IN IMPROPER USE OF CUSTOMER FUNDS, BY CONVERTING CUSTOMER FUNDS. LOGAN RECOMMENDED THAT AN INDIVIDUAL, A CLIENT AND CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER, PURCHASE AN ENTITY'S VARIABLE ANNUITY FOR $40,000. THE CLIENT EVENTUALLY PURCHASED THE ANNUITY, WHICH HE FUNDED THROUGH A $40,000 WITHDRAWAL FROM HIS IRA ACCOUNT. SUBSEQUENTLY, WHILE LOGAN WAS REGISTERED WITH HIS MEMBER FIRM, HE WITHDREW APPROXIMATELY $17,239.50 FROM THE CLIENT'S ANNUITY IN SEVERAL SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS, FOR LOGAN'S PERSONAL USE. AS A RESULT OF THE EARLY LIQUIDATIONS FROM THE ANNUITY, THE CLIENT INCURRED $841.61 IN SURRENDER CHARGES. IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH SUCH CONDUCT IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF THIS AWC, LOGAN CONTINUED TO WITHDRAW FUNDS FROM THE ANNUITY AFTER HE LEFT HIS FIRM AND WHILE HE WAS NO LONGER REGISTERED OR ASSOCIATED WITH A FINRA MEMBER FIRM. LOGAN WITHDREW APPROXIMATELY $11,442.87 FROM THE CLIENT'S ANNUITY IN SEVERAL ADDITIONAL SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS, FOR LOGAN'S PERSONAL USE. THE CLIENT HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF AND HAD NOT CONSENTED TO ANY OF THE WITHDRAWALS. IN ORDER TO AVOID DETECTION OF HIS MISCONDUCT, LOGAN CHANGED THE CLIENT'S ADDRESS OF RECORD FOR THE ANNUITY TO HIS FIRM OFFICE ADDRESS. AGAIN, SUBSEQUENTLY, LOGAN CHANGED THE ADDRESS OF RECORD TO A P.O. BOX, AS HE WAS NO LONGER WORKING AT THE FIRM OFFICE ADDRESS."",
