  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This information is for Alvin Van Richards. \""I have a long-term medical condition that led me to be disabled and not work full-time for several years. I have fortunately been able to receive medical treatment through four surgeries between 2015 and 2018 that have allowed me to regain reasonable functionality and return to work.  I did not file taxes for some years.  During my disability, I furthered my financial education to help me personally and professionally.  I have since filed all tax returns and have entered into a repayment plan where I am making monthly installments.""
