  ""Allegations"" : ""FINRA BY-LAWS ARTICLE V, SECTION 2, AND FINRA RULES 1122, 2010: JIMENEZ BECAME THE BROKER OF RECORD TO AN ELDERLY CUSTOMER AND HE CAUSED TWO SALES IN THE CUSTOMER'S BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. USING THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES, WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY $26,677, AS WELL AS MONEY IN THE CUSTOMER'S CASH SWEEP ACCOUNT, JIMENEZ PURCHASED SEVERAL SHARES OF A TAX FREE MUTUAL FUND IN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $30,000 IN THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT. THERE WAS A SALES CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE AND JIMENEZ WAS CREDITED INITIALLY, AS A RESULT, WITH A $1200 GROSS COMMISSION. BECAUSE THESE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVED THE SALE OF ONE MUTUAL FUND AND THE PURCHASE OF ANOTHER MUTUAL FUND WITH SALES CHARGES, THE FIRM'S POLICIES REQUIRED THE COMPLETION OF A SWITCH FORM, CALLED THE CLIENT INVESTMENT REPLACEMENT AUTHORIZATION FORM (CIRA FORM OR SWITCH FORM). THE CIRA FORM IS REQUIRED TO BE SIGNED BY THE CLIENT, THE BROKER, AND A MANAGER FROM THE FIRM. JIMENEZ FILLED OUT A CIRA FORM REFLECTING THE EXCHANGE FROM A MUTUAL FUND INTO ANOTHER MUTUAL FUND. JIMENEZ FORGED THE CUSTOMER'S SIGNATURE ON THE CIRA FORM. JIMENEZ NEVER SOUGHT PERMISSION FROM THE CUSTOMER TO SIGN HER NAME ON THE FORM, EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER HE SIGNED THE FORM. AT THE TIME JIMENEZ FORGED THE CUSTOMER'S SIGNATURE, HE KNEW HIS CONDUCT WAS IMPROPER AND CONTRARY TO HIS FIRM'S POLICY. IN ADDITION TO FORGING THE SIGNATURE, JIMENEZ INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED THE TRADE AS UNSOLICITED ON THE CIRA FORM AND ALSO MADE STATEMENTS IN THE BODY OF THE FORM THAT WERE NOT TRUE, INCLUDING THAT THE CUSTOMER WANTED TO SELL THE MUTUAL FUND BECAUSE SHE WAS UNHAPPY WITH ITS PERFORMANCE. THE CUSTOMER CALLED THE FIRM TO COMPLAIN THAT SHE HAD NOT AUTHORIZED THE TRANSACTIONS IN HER ACCOUNT. AFTER THE FIRM SENT HER A COPY OF THE CIRA FORM PURPORTEDLY CONTAINING HER SIGNATURE, SHE ADVISED THE FIRM THAT THE SIGNATURE WAS NOT HERS. THE FIRM COMPARED THE SIGNATURE ON THE CIRA FORM TO THE CUSTOMER'S NEW ACCOUNT DOCUMENTATION AND DETERMINED THAT THEY DID NOT MATCH. THE FIRM INTERVIEWED JIMENEZ. IN THAT INTERVIEW, JIMENEZ ADMITTED FORGING THE CUSTOMER'S SIGNATURE ON THE CIRA FORM. THE FIRM REVERSED THE TRADES AND REINSTATED THE CUSTOMER'S ORIGINAL POSITIONS. THE FIRM TERMINATED JIMENEZ FOR VIOLATING COMPANY POLICY. JIMENEZ ADMITTED TO FINRA DURING ITS INVESTIGATION THAT HE FORGED THE CUSTOMER'S SIGNATURE ON THE CIRA FORM. AFTER JIMENEZ'S TERMINATION FROM THE FIRM, HE BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER MEMBER FIRM AND HIS CURRENT FIRM FILED A FORM U4 REGISTERING HIM AND DISCLOSING HIS PREVIOUS TERMINATION FROM THE FORMER FIRM. JIMENEZ ENTERED THE FALSE MATERIAL INFORMATION ON HIS DISCLOSURE REPORTING PAGE (DRP). JIMENEZ CATEGORICALLY DENIED THE ALLEGATION, STATING THAT HE DID NOT SIGN THE SWITCHING LETTER IN QUESTION, AND THAT HE ONLY ACTED ON THE EXPRESSED AUTHORIZATION OF THE CLIENT. AT THE TIME JIMENEZ SIGNED THE FORM U4, HE HAD ALREADY ADMITTED TO FORGING THE SWITCH FORM. ACCORDINGLY, HIS EXPLICIT DENIAL OF SIGNING THE SWITCH FORM IN THE FORM U4 WAS WILLFULLY FALSE. JIMENEZ'S FALSE U4 STATEMENT WAS AGGRAVATING BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF AN EFFORT ON HIS PART TO MISLEAD HIS NEW FIRM ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO HIS TERMINATION. THE FIRM ALSO FILED A FORM U4 FOR JIMENEZ DISCLOSING FINRA'S INVESTIGATION OF JIMENEZ. JIMENEZ CAUSED THE FALSE MATERIAL INFORMATION TO BE ENTERED ON THE DRP. THESE STATEMENTS WERE FALSE AND JIMENEZ KNEW THEM TO BE FALSE. AGAIN, JIMENEZ CATEGORICALLY DENIED THE ALLEGATION, CONCERNING THE SIGNING OF THE SWITCHING LETTER IN QUESTION, AND THAT HE ACTED ON THE EXPRESSED AUTHORIZATION OF THE CLIENT. ACCORDINGLY, JIMENEZ'S FORM U4 WAS ALSO WILLFULLY FALSE. BETWEEN THE DATES OF THE FORMS U4, PURSUANT TO RULE 8210 AND CONSISTENT WITH HIS SIGNED STATEMENT TO HIS FORMER FIRM, JIMENEZ ADMITTED IN WRITING AND UNDER OATH TO FINRA THAT HE HAD FORGED THE CUSTOMER'S NAME TO THE SWITCH FORM. BY ENTERING OR CAUSING THE ENTRY OF FALSE INFORMATION ON TWO SEPARATE FORMS U4 JIMENEZ WILLFULLY REPORTED FALSE INFORMATION."",
