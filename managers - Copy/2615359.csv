  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Unbeknownst to me, this tax lien was due to my spouse not filing and paying our taxes during a period of time prior to 2014 when we were experiencing financial difficulties.  When I learned of the situation in late 2013 I hired a tax resolution firm and after filing all the missing tax returns they were able to have the IRS stop collection efforts on the unpaid taxes provided that going forward all future taxes were paid on time and my W4 filing status be changed to single 0.  The outstanding debt has been reduced by withholding refunds for the past 2 years.  I anticipate that the outstanding balance will be paid within the next 2 years or so.""
