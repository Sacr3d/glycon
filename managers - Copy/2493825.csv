  ""Judgment/Lien Amount"" : ""$31,676.24"",
  ""Judgment/Lien Type"" : ""Tax"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The IRS tax lien is the result of taxes that the IRS alleges are overdue. As explained to the IRS, the issue was caused by a retirement plan rollover into my current IRA that was erroneously categorized as a distribution.  My accountant and I have disputed the IRS tax lien several times, communicating with the IRS verbally as well as hard copy letters and are continuing to work to resolve the matter.""
