  ""Broker Comment"" : ""After many years of earning six figures in the early 2000s my family and I decided to build a house. We purchased 10 acres of land in Geneva, Florida and started the process of designing and financing our dream. We found a builder, finished the plans for the house and secured the financing. Before construction was complete the builder went bankrupt. As he had already received the final draw, the cost to complete went up. The house ended up being more expensive than planned.   In 2008 changes hit my place of employment and my pay was calculated differently. This led to an annual year over year decrease in my salary. By 2011 it was apparent that we could no longer afford our mortgage. However, the housing bubble had burst and the value of our property was now half of what we owed on it. We discussed options with the bank to no avail.  We found an avid buyer and discussed a short sale with the bank. They approved and showed an openness to work things out. We sold the property and moved to Eustis where we purchased a house that  fit our budget at that time. The bank must have had a change of heart because instead of discussing options with us, they filed suit.   Our new house and everything we owned was threatened. We were backed into a corner and had no other alternative but to file for bankruptcy, which we did in October of 2013. However, because I still had a job we filed under chapter 13 which restructured our debt and allowed us to make payments on it. We made payments consistently to the trusty and were on track to be completed within 5 years. Then, due to a management shake-up and restructuring at my job I was let go in January of 2016. We no longer had the income to make payments on our chapter 13 and it was converted to a chapter 7 and discharged because of my loss of employment.   It was a devastating and trying period in our family history and one we still feel great sorrow about. However we do not feel like it was brought on by a mismanagement of our resources as in most bankruptcy cases. We took a risk with the wrong people at the wrong time. The real estate bubble burst and the effect of the recession hit my job, both once we had already passed the point of no return in the construction process. There are certainly a hundred things I would have done differently looking back, but I am confident that the experience my family and I had is one that has given us wisdom and the authority to help people navigate through the economic challenges of their lives and to serve as a testimony that God can help us overcome any setback.""
