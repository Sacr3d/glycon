  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON MAY 28TH, 1990, I WAS ARRESTED, ALONG WITH THREE OTHER INDIVIDUALS, FOR PARTICIPATING IN A PRANK AGAINST A RIVAL SCHOOL.  THE PRANK INVOLVED TAKING A LACROSSE GOAL FROM A PRIVATE SCHOOL LOCATED IN KATONAH, NEW YORK.  THE FOUR OF US WERE APPREHENDED BY A TOWN OF BEDFORD POLICE OFFICER, AS WE WERE DRIVING AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL. TO TEACH US A LESSON, THE POLICE OFFICER ARRESTED US AND CHARGED EACH ONE OF US WITH A CLASS A MISDEMEANOR, POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY.  WHEN THE CASE WENT BEFORE A JUDGE ON JULY 26, 1990, THE JUDGE REALIZED THAT THE ACT WAS CONDUCTED MORE OUT OF FOOLISHNESS THEN CRIMINAL INTENT.  SEEING THAT NONE OF US HAD A CRIMINAL RECORD OR ANY HISTORY OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY, THE JUDGE DECIDED TO ADJUDICATE THE CHARGE WITH A CONDITIONAL DISMISSAL, REQUIRING US TO COMMIT NO FURTHER OFFENSES FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS, AT WHICH TIME THE CASE WOULD BE DISMISSED.  THE CASE WAS OFFICIALLY DISPOSED OF SIX MONTHS LATER ON JANUARY 3RD, 1991.  ""
