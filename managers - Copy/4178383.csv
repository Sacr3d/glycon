  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON JANUARY 24, 1999, I, MICHAEL MACKE WROTE A CHECK TO PUBLIX WHICH BOUNCED DUE TO AN OVERSIGHT ON MY PART. WHEN I MADE RESTITUTION TO PUBLIX, I ASSUMED THAT THE MATTER WOULD BE CLOSED JUST AS IT HAD BEEN WHEN I REPAID MY VETERINARIAN, BUT THIS TIME, I WAS REQUIRED TO GO TO COURT. WHEN I WENT TO COURT, I WAS NOT REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY. I TOLD THE JUDGE THAT I HAD MADE RESTITUTION AND HE ORDERED ME TO PAY $125.00 IN COURT COSTS, WHICH I DID. AT THE REQUEST OF THE FLORIDA OFFICE OF FINANCIAL REGULATION, I RECENTLY OBTAINED AND PROVIDED A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE DISPOSITION OF THIS MATTER. UPON RECEIPT OF THE DISPOSITION DOCUMENT, I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT I HAD ENTERED A PLEA OF \""NOLO CONTENDERE\"" TO A CRIMINAL MISDEMEANOR CHARGE OF PASSING A WORTHLESS BANK CHECK. I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION THAT THIS IS WHAT OCCURRED IN COURT.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON NOVEMBER 8, 1997, I WROTE A CHECK TO MY VETERINARIAN AS A DEPOSIT FOR A MEDICAL DEVICE FOR MY DOG, WHICH WAS TO BE USED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND THEN RETURNED. I FAILED TO RETURN THE DEVICE ON TIME AND THE VETERINARIAN CASHED MY CHECK BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO TAKE THE DEVICE BACK. BY THE TIME THE CHECK WAS CASHED, I HAD EITHER CLOSED THE ACCOUNT OR DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS AT THAT TIME TO COVER THE CHECK. AFTER LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTACT, I MADE RESTITUTION TO THE VETERINARIAN. I DON'T BELIEVE I WAS REQUIRED TO GO TO COURT. AT THE REQUEST OF THE FLORIDA OFFICE OF FINANCIAL REGULATION, I RECENTLY OBTAINED AND PROVIDED A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE DISPOSITION OF THIS CASE. UPON RECEIPT OF THE DISPOSITION DOCUMENT, I LEARNED THAT I HAD ACTUALLY BEEN CRIMINALLY CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR, AND THAT THE CHARGE HAD BEEN \""NOLLE PROSEUI.\"" ALL I KNEW WAS THAT THE MATTER HAD BEEN RESOLVED WHEN I MADE RESTITUTION.""
