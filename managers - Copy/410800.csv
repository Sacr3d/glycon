  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THERE WERE TWO ISSUES IN THIS CASE. THE FIRST IS TRADE CORRECTIONS NOT BEING MADE IN AN ERROR ACCOUNT. I ACTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTIONS I RECEIVED FROM MY COMPANY OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT. THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT I PLACED TRADES WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION OF MY CLIENT. THE CLIENT AUTHORIZED THE PLACEMENT OF THE ORDERS. AT NO TIME DID THE CLIENT WITHDRAW THE ORDER BEFORE OR WELL AFTER THE AUTHORITY CEASED. I HAD RESIGNED FROM MY BD WHEN THESE CHARGES CAME.  MY NEW BD WOULD NOT ACCEPT ME WITHOUT CLEARING THIS MATTER. SO I FELT OBLIGED TO ACCEPT. MY COMMENTS AT THE TIME ARE STILL HOW I SEE THE EVENTS.""
