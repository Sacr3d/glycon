THIS INCLUDED 2 CHECKS WRITTEN SEVERAL WEEKS PRIOR TO RESIGNATION AND BLANK DOCUMENTS SIGNED BY THE CLIENT.  ALSO, ALLEGATIONS WERE UNDER REVIEW THAT A CLIENT WAS TOLD TO PAY FOR INVESTMENTS IN CASH, AND THE CLIENT DID SO ON ONE OCCASION.  THE INTERNAL REVIEW INDICATED THAT I DID NOT TELL THE CLIENT TO PAY IN CASH, BUT DID VIOLATE FIRM POLICY BY ACCEPTING CASH IN THIS ONE INSTANCE.  THE INTERNAL REVIEW WAS CONCLUDED AS NO ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS WERE FOUND.  INTERNAL REVIEW CONCLUDED - 5/18/2000.""
