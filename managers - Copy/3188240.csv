  ""Broker Comment"" : ""SERVING THE NEEDS OF THE CLIENT IS ALWAYS MOST IMPORTANT.  IN EARLY MAY 2005, I LEFT ACTIVE WORK STATUS WITH SOVEREIGN BANK UNDER THE FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT IN ORDER TO CARE FOR A CRITICALLY ILL RELATIVE.  SOVEREIGN BANK INVESTMENT SERVICES PLACED A FINANCIAL ADVISOR IN CHARGE TO MANAGE ALL OF MY FORMER CLIENTS INCLUDING [CUSTOMER] IN MY ABSENCE AS I OFFICIALLY HAD NO CONTACT WITH ANY CLIENTS DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME.  THIS ISSUE COMMENCED AS [CUSTOMER] BEGAN CALLING AND LEAVING MESSAGES IN ORDER TO DISCUSS AND REVIEW HIS ACCOUNT.  IT IS VERY UNFORTUNATE TO LEARN THAT THE ADVISOR DID NOT RETURN THE CALLS AND MESSAGES OF [CUSTOMER].  SEVERAL MONTHS EARLIER, I HAD EXPLAINED THE TERMS OF THE ANNUITY AND ENSURED HIS ASSETS WERE PLACED IN THE MOST SUITABLE INVESTMENT VEHICLE AT THE TIME WE DISCUSSED AND AGREED UPON THE INVESTMENT.  [CUSTOMER] EXPLAINS IN HIS LETTER, THIRD PARAGRAPH, \""AT THE TIME OF THE AGREEMENT, MR. WINTHER EXPLAINED THAT THIS WAS A DIVERSIFIED FUND WHICH WOULD PROVIDE ME FUTURE INCOME.\""  [CUSTOMER] STATES HIS CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS INVESTMENT, PER OUR CONVERSATION, WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE HIM FUTURE INCOME, NOT PRESENT INCOME.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN THE ANNUITY THAT ALLOW INCOME TO BE WITHDRAWN EARLIER, ALTHOUGH [CUSTOMER] IS CLEAR THAT THE INVESTMENT WAS FOR FUTURE AND NOT PRESENT INCOME.  IT IS LATER IN [CUSTOMER]'S LETTER IN WHICH HE STATES HIS DESIRE TO ACCESS CASH IN THE PRESENT, WHICH CONFLICTS WITH HIS EARLIER STATEMENT IN WHICH HE CONFIRMS THE INVESTMENT IS FOR FUTURE AND NOT PRESENT INCOME.  AGAIN, THERE ARE PROVISIONS FOR [CUSTOMER] TO ACCESS CASH SOONER, SO ACCESS TO CASH DOES EXIST IF NEEDED.  ALSO, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS CONTRACT IS ONLY FOR FOUR YEARS, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN MANY CONTRACTS WHICH ARE AS LONG AS SIX, SEVEN AND EVEN TEN YEARS.  ALL ASPECTS OF THE INVESTMENT WERE DISCUSSED WITH [CUSTOMER], AND [CUSTOMER] WAS AWARE OF THE PURPOSE AND WORKINGS OF THIS INVESTMENT""
