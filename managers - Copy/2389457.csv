  ""Broker Comment"" : ""On 1/3/2019, I was informed that a Federal Tax Lien was filed against me in Palm Beach County Florida in 2008.  This is the first time I have heard of it.  It has never shown up in previous U-4 filings or in any other personal transactions.  The notice does have my name and an address I am familiar with as a previous personal address as a renter.  Unfortunately, due to the current government shutdown my CPA is unable to provide any comprehensive guidance as to how this could have occurred and/or to how it can be resolved.  My CPA has filed a lengthy detailed request with the IRS and as soon as the shutdown backlog is resolved I will update this statement.""
