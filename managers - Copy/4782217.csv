  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In reaction to the COVID 19 outbreak, there were unprecedented volatility and it started around beginning of March. On March 10th I got an email from our back-office which the client sent on March 9th. Since we can't take clients orders via email, I called the client to confirm the sell order but towards the end of the conversation she changed her mind and wanted to stay invested. A week later, she contacted our back-office again to place the trade and filed a complaint against me that we didn't execute her sell order a week prior.  As the representative of record on her account for 7 years, I have always given her prudent advise based on her investment objectives and risk tolerance  so she can make her own decisions.""
