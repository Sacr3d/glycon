  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Matter was settled by the firm to avoid the uncertainty of litigation. Mr. Lawson denies all wrong doing as alleged and maintains that all investments were suitable and appropriate. While under Mr. Lawson's management, the customer's account achieved significant gains and any decline in account value was directly attributable to withdrawals made by the customer. This matter was resolved solely as a business decision on behalf of the firm, for a portion of estimated additional costs of defense, and Mr. Lawson did not contribute to the resolution.""
