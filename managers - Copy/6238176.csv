  ""Broker Comment"" : ""My family and I recently relocated to Jacksonville, FL from Colorado Springs, CO in August 2015. The notification about the Judgment was received in Sept 2015. During that time, I was unemployed. I have been in contacted with the firm handling the Judgment explaining the circumstances. My priority is to satisfy the balance owed based upon the settlement agreement that is in negotiation. Once this goal is accomplished, I will update the information on my U4 Form. Any previous Judgments have been satisfied, which I have received documentation solidifying this fact. Thank you.""
