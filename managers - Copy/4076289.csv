NATIONWIDE GOT ALL THE BUSINESS AND I WAS LEFT HOLDING THE NOTE. I COULDN'T MAKE PAYMENTS ON THE NOTE SINCE I WAS OUT OF WORK FOR 15 MONTHS SO JUDITH JOHNSON CALLED THE NOTE DUE IN FULL.

SINCE I OWN NOTHING IN MY NAME/PERSONALLY I CHOSE TO GO WITH THE JUDGEMENT.""

It is not showing up as a derogatory account on the credit reports I have and I can't seem to gather any more information on it.  When I contacted the Gaston County Clerk of Courts the man told me that all he could find on his system using the date and docket number was the name of Discover Bank as the other party.""
