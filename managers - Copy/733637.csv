  ""Initiated By"" : ""UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""The Securities and Exchange Commission (the \""Commission\""), for its Complaint against Pagliara, alleges that CapWealth Advisors, LLC (\""CapWealth\""), Timothy J. Pagliara (\""Pagliara\"") and Timothy R. Murphy (\""Murphy\"") (collectively \""Defendants\"") purchased, recommended, or held for advisory clients mutual fund share classes that charged fees pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\""12b-1 fees\""), even though lower cost share classes of the same funds were available. CapWealth's affiliated broker-dealer received 12b-1 fees from these investments and shared portions of the fees with Pagliara and Murphy, who were registered representatives of the broker-dealer. Pagliara instructed the broker-dealer to send the 12b-1 fees from his clients' accounts to CapWealth's holding company, of which Pagliara was the majority owner and through which he received compensation from his advisory and brokerage roles. Separately, Murphy received 12b-1 fees from his clients' mutual fund investments as a portion of the compensation he received. Defendants failed to disclose adequately the material conflicts of interests with respect to the 12b-1 fees Pagliara and Murphy received, through CapWealth's affiliated broker-dealer, from their advisory clients' investments in mutual funds. Defendants' failure to disclose adequately these material conflicts of interests prevented their advisory clients from the opportunity to provide informed consent to these conflicts. CapWealth owed its advisory clients a fiduciary duty to act in their best interests and to fully disclose all material facts about the advisory relationship, including disclosing any conflicts of interest. CapWealth failed to disclose adequately the conflicts of interests with respect to 12b-1 fees. Its Forms ADV Part 2A brochures disclosed only that firm \""principals\"" may receive 12b-1 fees, making no mention of the financial benefits to Murphy, who was not a firm principal, and not otherwise disclosing that CapWealth was indeed investing advisory clients in 12b-1 fee paying share classes when lower-cost share classes were available, or the conflicts of interest associated therewith. Pagliara owed his advisory clients a fiduciary duty to act in their best interests and to fully disclose all material facts about the advisory relationship, including disclosing any conflicts of interest. Pagliara failed to disclose adequately the conflicts of interests to his advisory clients. For example, Pagliara's individual Forms ADV Part 2B Brochure Supplements made no mention of him receiving 12b-1 fees, nor did the management agreement governing his relationship with his advisory clients. Murphy owed his advisory clients a fiduciary duty to act in their best interests and to fully disclose all material facts about the advisory relationship, including disclosing any conflicts of interest. Murphy failed to disclose adequately the conflicts of interests to his advisory clients. For example, Murphy's individual Forms ADV Part 2B Brochure Supplements made no mention of him receiving 12b-1 fees, nor did the management agreement governing his relationship with his advisory clients. Moreover, Murphy made misleading statements to advisory clients regarding the availability of lower-cost share classes. In addition, the Defendants breached their duty to seek best execution for their clients by investing them in share classes with 12b-1 fees rather than lower-cost share classes of the same funds. Finally, CapWealth failed to adopt and implement written compliance policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\""Advisers Act\"") and the rules thereunder in connection with its mutual fund share class selection practices.   By the conduct detailed in this Complaint, Defendants violated Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act and CapWealth violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder."",
