  ""Judgment/Lien Amount"" : ""$5,800.00"",
  ""Judgment/Lien Type"" : ""Civil"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I have [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED] & severe [REDACTED] in my legs, as well as impaired mobility. I've had excessive medical bills over the past few years. I was on short-term disability for much of 2017, so my income was impaired as well. I've had emergency room visits and over night stays at Community Hospital. I've worked hard to regain my mobility and get back to work. I do not dispute the bills. I've paid all past bill with Community Hospital. Again, I was informed of the judgments after the fact, and I am making payments even though the debt collector's office has not taken or returned my calls.""
