  ""Broker Comment"" : ""REGARDING [CUSTOMER]:     WHEN I MET WITH [CUSTOMER] (DECEMBER 26TH AT HER HOME) SHE REQUESTED THAT SHE RECEIVE A ONE TIME DISBURSEMENT OF $50,000 AND START A SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL FROM HER RETIREMENT OF $5,000 PER MONTH UNTIL HER PENSION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT KICKS IN AT 60.       I TOLD HER THAT IT MAY BE A WEEK OR SO BEFORE SHE COULD HAVE THE 1 TIME DISTRIBUTION BECAUSE THE MSU HR OFFICE WAS CLOSED FOR CHRISTMAS VACATION.  SHE VERBALIZED THAT SHE WAS VERY PUT OUT BY THE BENEFITS OFFICE DUE TO SEVERAL BLUNDERS DURING THE PROCESSING OF HER RETIREMENT AND WANTED THEM OUT OF THE LOOP.       I SPECIFICALLY TOLD HER THAT SHE NEEDED TO KEEP ENOUGH MONEY IN HER MSU ACCOUNT TO COVER HER SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL UNTIL SHE TURNED 59.5 TO AVOID A 10% PENALTY.  SHE THEN FILLED OUT PAPERWORK TO TAKE A ONE TIME WITHDRAWAL OF $50,000, A SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL OF $5,000, AND PAPERWORK TO ROLL THE REMAINDER TO AN IRA SO WHICH SHE COULD ACCESS AFTER 59.5 WITHOUT FEDERAL PENALTY.  I MADE SURE TO CLARIFY THAT SHE WOULD NOT NEED TO CONTINUE TAKING OUT MORE THAN 10% ONCE SHE REACHED 59.5.  SHE SIGNED ALL IRA FORMS INCLUDING ATDF WHICH SPECIFICALLY STATES SURRENDER SCHEDULE.     THE FACT THAT [CUSTOMER] WANTS FULL LIQUIDITY YET WOULD LIKE TO ROLL ALL OF HER FUNDS TO AN IRA WHICH WILL INCUR 10% EARLY WITHDRAWAL PENALTY FOR THE NEXT 8+ MONTHS PROVES THAT SHE DID NOT LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY DURING OUR LAST MEETING, OR MAYBE THAT THE ADVISOR CURRENTLY CONSULTING HER IN TEXAS IS THE ONE WHO IS THE ONE NOT LOOKING OUT FOR HER BEST INTEREST.     FURTHER THE CLIENT NEVER TOLD ME TO CHANGE HER ADDRESS.  SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULD BE KEEPING BOTH HOMES AND THAT MAIL COULD CONTINUE COMING TO HER STARKVILLE HOME.     IN CLOSING, AT NO TIME DID I OMIT MATERIAL INFORMATION OR MISLEAD CLIENT [CUSTOMER] DURING THIS PROCESS.  I ENGAGED IN NO WRONG OR UNETHICAL CONDUCT WHEN ASSISTING [CUSTOOMER] AND FIND IT ABSURD THAT SHE WOULD FILE A COMPLAINT USING SUCH A HIGH LEVEL OF SELECTIVE AND REVISIONIST MEMORY.       I AM INDIFFERENT AS TO THE COURSE THAT VALIC CHOOSES TO TAKE ON THIS MATTER, BUT I REFUSE TO TAKE ANY BLAME FOR GIVING THE CLIENT UNSUITABLE ADVICE.""
