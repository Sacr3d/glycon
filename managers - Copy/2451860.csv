  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I RECOMMENDED THE YIELD PLUS FUND TO THE CLIENT AS A HIGHER YIELDING ALTERNATIVE TO MONEY MARKETS AT NO TIME DID I SAY THE FUND WOULD NOT FLUCTUATE. UP UNTIL THE CREDIT BUBBLE OCCURRED SINCE 2003 THE SCHWAB YIELD PLUS NEVER FLUCTUATED VERY MUCH AND WAS A VERY STABLE FUND NEVER VARYING MORE THAN 2% EITHER WAY. ALSO THE SCHWAB YIELD PLUS FUND WAS ON OUR SELECT LIST WHICH MEANT WE WERE ABLE TO RECOMMEND IT. THE RECENT SELLOFF IN SHARE PRICE IS IN PART DUE TO OTHER SCHWAB FUNDS SELLING THE YIELD PLUS FUND. I LEFT SCHWAB IN MID JANUARY OF 2008.  HAD I STILL BEEN AT SCHWAB I WOULD HAVE MET WITH THE CLIENT AND RECOMMENDED SELLING THE SCHWAB YIELD PLUS SINCE MOST OF THE LOSES HAVE OCCURRED IN 2008. IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT ECONOMY AND CONDITION OF THE MARKETS I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT SCHWAB REASSIGN MY FORMER CLIENTS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE STILL IN APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS.""
