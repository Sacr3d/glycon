  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS RECENTLY ADVISED THAT A RECORD SEARCH INDICATED THAT A TAX LIEN WAS ISSUED AGAINST ME BY THE IRS. I DO NOT BELIEVE A LIEN WAS ISSUED AGAINST ME, BUT AM MAKING THIS DISCLOSURE OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION. I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A TAX DISPUTE WITH THE IRS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, AND THE MATTER IS BEING HANDLED BY MY ACCOUNTANTS. I NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTICE THAT A LIEN WAS ISSUED AGAINST ME, AND NO INDICATION OF ANY LIEN HAS EVER APPEARED ON CREDIT REPORTS I HAVE RECEIVED IN THE PAST.""
