THE CLIENT APPROVED THE PURCHASES. IN 2009 THE CLIENT SENT AN EMAIL TO THE REP WHICH INCLUDED, \""YOU HONESTLY EXPLAINED THE RISKS AND SHOWED THE GREAT PERFORMANCE OF THE FRANKLIN FUNDS ETC.  I HAVE NO ISSUE THERE AT ALL\"".  WHEN THE MARKET DECLINED 3 YEARS LATER, THE CLIENT UNILATERALLY SOLD THE FUNDS AND REALIZED A LOSS.  THEREAFTER, THE CLIENT ALLEGED THAT HE INITIALLY WANTED TO PURCHASE CD'S BUT WAS MISLED INTO PURCHASING MUTUAL FUNDS.  THE CLIENT NEVER ADVISED THE REP THAT HE WANTED THE SECURITY OF CD'S.  THE CLIENT'S LOSS WAS THE RESULT OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS EVER MISLED. ACCORDINGLY, CFS DENIED THE CLIENT'S REQUEST FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF HIS LOSSES. **CLIENT'S ATTORNEY SUBSEQUENTLY FILED A CIVIL LITIGATION ON THIS MATTER."",
