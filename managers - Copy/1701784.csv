  ""Type"" : ""Bankruptcy"",
  ""Disposition"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""As part of a recruiting package from Ameriprise Financial, Inc. I received a large sum of money given in the form of a forgivable loan.  This sum became due after I resigned prior to meeting the terms of that agreement.  I resigned due to ethical breaches by the local and regional management for which I refused to ignore.  As a result, I was the target of coercion and retaliation against me and co-workers.  Rather than enter into a long and expensive legal battle, I filed for protection under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code. This bankruptcy has now been closed and I have reaffirmed both my home mortgage and my SBA disaster loan from hurricane Katrina and only discharged the Ameriprise debt and some small credit card balances.""
