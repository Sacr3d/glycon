  ""Allegations"" : ""McNamara was named a respondent in a FINRA complaint alleging that he failed to promptly disclose to his member firm outside brokerage accounts in which he held a beneficial interest. The complaint alleges that McNamara received reminders from the firm to make all required disclosures regarding all outside securities accounts and he acknowledged on multiple occasions that he was aware of his obligation to do so. McNamara completed and signed the firm's annual disclosure forms, relating to providing prompt written notice of such information to the firm, thereby acknowledging that he understood this obligation. The complaint also alleges that McNamara purchased shares of an equity IPO through a disclosed outside brokerage account he held at another FINRA member firm. McNamara was prohibited from purchasing the IPO because, at the time of the purchase, he was registered with his firm. McNamara was reminded by his firm's CCO on separate occasions of the firm's policy prohibiting participation in equity IPOs. The complaint further alleges that McNamara falsely represented to the other firm that he was eligible to purchase the equity IPOS. McNamara completed, signed and submitted the client affirmation form to his financial advisor at the other firm falsely attesting that the account in which he was purchasing the equity IPO was not beneficially owned 10 percent or more by a restricted person and that he was eligible to purchase equity IPOs."",

  ""Regulator Statement"" : ""Hearing Panel Decision rendered June 13, 2018, wherein McNamara was fined $10,000, suspended from association with any FINRA member in all capacities for three months, required to requalify by examination as a General Securities Representative prior to reentering the securities industry, and ordered to pay $3,804.29 in costs. The sanctions were based on findings that McNamara failed to disclose to his member firm six outside brokerage accounts in which he held a beneficial interest and was reckless in not disclosing these accounts. The findings stated that McNamara was confronted with, but did not pay attention to, a number of red flags telling him he was required to disclose to the firm all outside brokerage accounts in his name or in which he had a beneficial interest for both the pre-association accounts and the post-association accounts. McNamara completed annual disclosure forms in which he agreed to provide the firm with prompt written notice of all brokerage accounts in which he had an interest and to ensure that copies of all confirmation statements were sent to the compliance department. McNamara acknowledged his responsibility to notify the firm in writing of all brokerage accounts in which he had an interest and held outside of the firm. The findings also stated that McNamara improperly purchased shares in an equity initial public offering (IPO). McNamara was reckless in the purchase of the IPO shares. McNamara was confronted with, but did not pay attention to, a number of red flags telling him he was a restricted person who was prohibited from purchasing shares in an equity IPO. When McNamara was hired, he received the firm's compliance manual, which contained the firm's prohibition on equity IPOs. It prohibited employees from participating in an IPO without written authorization from the compliance department. McNamara was reminded by his firm's CCO through emails stating no employee could purchase equity IPOs in any account in which he had control or a beneficial interest. The executing member firm client affirmation form stated it was not permitted to sell IPO shares to restricted persons or their family members. The form directed McNamara to read the form's definitions, answer the questions and, if eligible, affirm his eligibility by signing the client affirmation form. McNamara read the definition of restricted person in the form. McNamara's purchase of the IPO shares was the result of considerable thought and deliberation. The findings also included that McNamara gave a false answer on the executing firm's client affirmation form of eligibility for IPOs in connection with the IPO purchase and he acted recklessly with this action. McNamara read the definition of restricted person, but checked the \""no\"" box, representing that the account he intended to use in purchasing the IPO shares was not beneficially owned 10 percent or more by one or more restricted persons. This representation was false.   On July 5, 2018, McNamara filed an appeal of the decision.    NAC Decision rendered July 30, 2019. The NAC modified the findings and sanctions imposed by the OHO. The sanctions were based on findings that McNamara failed to disclose to his member firm brokerage accounts held at another FINRA member firm, improperly purchased equity initial public offering (IPO) shares in an account held at that firm, and provided inaccurate information to that firm in order to purchase those shares. The findings stated that FINRA vacated the Hearing Panel's finding of liability and dismiss cause one with respect to two of the accounts. The findings also stated that the Hearing Panel had concluded that McNamara acted recklessly. However, FINRA has now concluded that McNamara acted negligently, not recklessly, with his failure to disclose all of the new accounts, when he provided inaccurate information, and purchased the equity IPO shares. The decision became final September 3, 2019.""
