  ""Allegations"" : ""FINRA RULE 2010, NASD RULE 3010: TECHAR FAILED TO SUPERVISE A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE WHO CONVERTED APPROXIMATELY $1.1 MILLION OF CUSTOMER FUNDS THROUGH A SCHEME IN WHICH THE REPRESENTATIVE SOLD A FICTITIOUS INVESTMENT FUND TO CUSTOMERS. TECHAR WAS A PARTIAL OWNER OF HIS MEMBER FIRM, AS WAS THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE. TECHAR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPERVISING THE REPRESENTATIVE, WHICH INCLUDED ENSURING THAT SHE WAS NOT ENGAGED IN UNAPPROVED OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS. AS PART OF TECHAR'S SUPERVISORY DUTIES, HE REVIEWED MANY OF THE REPRESENTATIVE'S EMAILS ON A REGULAR BASIS. TECHAR REVIEWED MANY OF THE REPRESENTATIVE'S EMAILS IN WHICH SHE DISCUSSED THE INVESTMENT FUND WITH HER CUSTOMERS. THESE EMAILS MADE IT APPARENT THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OWNED AND CONTROLLED THE FUND AND THAT SHE WAS SOLICITING HER CUSTOMERS TO INVEST IN THIS FUND. THE REPRESENTATIVE NEVER DISCLOSED HER ENTITY'S ACTIVITIES TO THE FIRM. TECHAR REVIEWED THESE EMAILS, YET HE NEVER QUESTIONED THE REPRESENTATIVE ABOUT THE FUND. TECHAR'S FAILURE TO FOLLOW UP ON THESE EMAILS, WHICH WERE RED FLAGS OF THE REPRESENTATIVE'S QUESTIONABLE ACTIVITIES INVOLVING THE FUND, ALLOWED HER MISCONDUCT TO CONTINUE FOR AT LEAST NINE MONTHS AFTER IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED AND ADDRESSED. THE FIRM PROVIDED RESTITUTION TO THE INVESTORS WHO LOST MONEY THROUGH THE REPRESENTATIVE'S SCHEME, TO WHICH TECHAR CONTRIBUTED HIS OWN FUNDS TO PAY FOR PART OF THIS RESTITUTION TO THE INVESTORS."",
