  ""Broker Comment"" : ""1. The complaint was not filed on Opening as it was a Verbal Complaint on Opening hence the filing should not be considered late.  2. I made an honest mistake and forgot to place an order.   Once I became aware that these trades had not been placed, I reported my mistake to the firm to make sure my client was not financially harmed.  I pride myself in doing the right thing and wanted to ensure my client was made whole.  Because I feel ethical standards are paramount, I affirm that nothing unethical occurred during this situation and happy to report that the client remains a client of mine.""
