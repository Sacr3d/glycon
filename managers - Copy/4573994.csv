  ""Broker Comment"" : ""A client called me to make an emergency $4,000 NET wire distribution for a wedding from her Wells Fargo Advisors IRA Brokerage account. I assisted her in completing the distribution form over the phone. She signed and sent the form back to me, however, she failed to complete the dollar amount on the form. With the client on the phone, I completed the dollar amount and processed the transaction upon her request to meet the wire deadline. I then sent the client a new form to receive her initials and signature confirming the dollar amount. I was acting in the best interest and full faith of the client and laterally protecting the firm's reputation.""
