  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 22102, SEPTEMBER 23, 2011: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TODAY FILED TWO SEPARATE COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE THREE FORMER PRINCIPALS OF A NOW-DEFUNCT BROKER-DEALER - NAMELY JEFF GREENEY, THE BROKER-DEALER'S THEN CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, THE BROKER-DEALER'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) AND THE BROKER-DEALER'S CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER, AND THEIR RELATED ENTITIES. THE COMMISSION ALLEGES THAT THE CEO AND CCO COMMITTED SECURITIES FRAUD BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ENGAGING IN MARKET MANIPULATION IN A BROADER MANIPULATIVE SCHEME, AND ALSO, THROUGH THEIR TWO RESPECTIVE RELATED ENTITIES, VIOLATED THE REGISTRATION PROVISIONS OF SECTION 5(A) AND (C) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (\""SECURITIES ACT\"") BY SELLING STOCK IN UNLAWFUL UNREGISTERED OFFERINGS. THE COMMISSION SEPARATELY ALLEGED THAT GREENEY, THROUGH HIS RELATED ENTITY, VIOLATED THE REGISTRATION PROVISIONS BY SELLING STOCK IN UNLAWFUL UNREGISTERED OFFERINGS.  THE COMMISSION ALLEGES THAT THE CEO AND CCO, IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 17(A) OF THE SECURITIES ACT SECTION 10(B) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND RULE 10B-5(A) AND (C) THEREUNDER, PARTICIPATED IN A BROADER MARKET MANIPULATION RING THAT INVOLVED BRINGING COMPANIES PUBLIC THROUGH REVERSE MERGERS; USING THE BROKER-DEALER TO RAISE FUNDS FOR THE NEWLY-CREATED COMPANIES THROUGH PURPORTED PRIVATE PLACEMENTS; AND MANIPULATING THE PUBLIC MARKETS FOR THOSE NEWLY-CREATED PUBLIC COMPANIES, WHICH ALLOWED THE CEO AND CCO, THROUGH THEIR RELATED ENTITIES, TO SELL THEIR HOLDINGS OF THESE COMPANIES AT ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED PRICES FOR TOTAL PROCEEDS EXCEEDING $1.5 MILLION.  IN PARTICULAR, THE COMMISSION ALLEGES THAT THE CEO ENGAGED IN VARIOUS MANIPULATIVE ACTIVITIES INCLUDING COORDINATED AND MATCHED TRADING ACTIVITY, AND THAT THE CCO SIMILARLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF MANIPULATIVE ACTIVITIES INCLUDING ASSUMING TRADING AUTHORITY AND CONTROL OVER MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS TO CONDUCT COORDINATED TRADING ACTIVITY. IN ONE EMAIL, THE CEO COMPLAINED TO ANOTHER SCHEME PARTICIPANT THAT HE, NOT THE CEO, SHOULD CONDUCT THE MANIPULATIVE TRADING BY WRITING, \""MY JOB IS TO BRING IN ALL THE MONEY AND YOURS [IS] TO COVER THE BID,\"" WHICH REFERRED TO ENTERING BUY ORDERS TO KEEP THE STOCK PRICE AT AN ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED LEVEL. THE CCO, IN AN EMAIL TO THE CEO AND ANOTHER SCHEME PARTICIPANT, EXPLAINED THAT HE ENGAGED IN MANIPULATION TO KEEP AN ISSUER'S STOCK PRICE AT A CERTAIN RANGE - A RANGE THAT HE BELIEVED WAS NEEDED TO FACILITATE THE BROKER-DEALER'S CONCURRENT PRIVATE PLACEMENT INVOLVING THAT ISSUER.  WITH RESPECT TO GREENEY, THE COMMISSION ALLEGES THAT HE, THROUGH HIS RELATED ENTITY, SOLD SHARES IN UNREGISTERED OFFERINGS OF TWO OF THE MICROCAP ISSUERS FOR UNLAWFUL PROFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $330,000, IN VIOLATION OF THE REGISTRATION PROVISIONS OF THE SECURITIES ACT. GREENEY AND HIS RELATED ENTITY HAVE OFFERED TO SETTLE THE COMMISSION'S ALLEGATIONS BY CONSENTING, WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE ALLEGATIONS, TO AN INJUNCTION AGAINST FUTURE VIOLATIONS OF SECURITIES ACT SECTIONS 5(A) AND 5(C), TO BE BARRED FROM PARTICIPATING IN AN OFFERING OF PENNY STOCK FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS, AND TO PAY DISGORGEMENT AND PENALTIES IN AMOUNTS TO BE DETERMINED BY THE COURT. THE OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BY GREENEY AND HIS RELATED ENTITY ARE SUBJECT TO THE COURT'S APPROVAL. GREENEY HAS ALSO OFFERED TO SETTLE A YET-TO-BE INSTITUTED ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING AGAINST HIM, IN WHICH GREENEY WOULD CONSENT, IF THE COURT ENTERS AN INJUNCTION AGAINST HIM, TO AN ORDER BARRING HIM FROM ASSOCIATION WITH ANY BROKER, DEALER, INVESTMENT ADVISER, MUNICIPAL SECURITIES DEALER, MUNICIPAL ADVISOR, TRANSFER AGENT, OR NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATION WITH THE RIGHT TO REAPPLY FOR ADMISSION AFTER THREE YEARS."",
