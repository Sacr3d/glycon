  ""Broker Comment"" : ""EXPLANATION FROM LUIS GIL (DATED 4/30/15):  TO BE CONSIDERED A CANDIDATE FOR THE JR. SALESPERSON POSITION AT HSBC ONE HAD TO BE ALREADY APPROPRIATELY LICENSED. THAT IS, THE CANDIDATE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE ALREADY BEEN REGISTERED AS A SERIES 7 AND 63 LICENSE HOLDER.   WHILE AT MY PREVIOUS EMPLOYER, ROCHDALE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT (NOW CITY NATIONAL ROCHDALE), WE WERE REQUIRED TO PASS THE SERIES 7 AND SERIES 66 EXAMS. THE SERIES 66 EXAM IS THE EQUIVALENT OF BOTH THE SERIES 63 AND SERIES 65 EXAMS. PASSING THE SERIES 66 EXAM IS THE SAME AS PASSING BOTH THE SERIES 63 AND SERIES 65 EXAMS IN THE EYES OF FINRA. THE SERIES 7 EXAM WAS PASSED IN THE SPRING OF 2012 AND THE SERIES 66 WAS PASSED IN THE FALL OF 2012. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, ROCHDALE REGISTERED EACH LICENSE SHORTLY AFTER PASSING EACH EXAM.   I BEGAN THE APPLICATION AND INTERVIEW PROCESS AT HSBC IN JUNE OF 2014. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE AT THE TIME OF THE APPLICATION AND INTERVIEWING PROCESS MY LICENSES HAD STILL NOT EXPIRED. IN LATE JULY AND AUGUST OF 2014 HSBC CONDUCTED A BACKGROUND CHECK, WHICH SUPPOSEDLY CHECKED THE REGULATORY AGENCIES FOR THE REGISTRATION OF MY LICENSES. NOTHING WAS REPORTED TO ME OR MY MANAGING DIRECTOR WITH REGARD TO ANY LICENSE DEFICIENCIES OR ANY POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH ANY REGULATORY AGENCY. I BEGAN WORKING AT HSBC ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2014. WITHIN A FEW DAYS, PERHAPS THREE DAYS, I BEGAN ACCEPTING AND EXECUTING CLIENT ORDERS. THIS WAS BEFORE MY LICENSES WERE TRANSFERRED TO HSBC. DURING THE TRANSFER PROCESS THE HSBC COMPLIANCE STAFF FOUND THAT MY SERIES 7 HAD EXPIRED AS I HAD NEVER COMPLETED THE CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENT. I HAD NOT KNOWN THAT I NEEDED THE CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENT TO CONTINUE BEING IN GOOD STANDING WITH FINRA. WITHIN A SHORT-TIME OF FINDING THIS OUT, I REGISTERED TO COMPLETE THE CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENT. LITERALLY, THE NEXT DAY, I TOOK THE CONTINUING EDUCATION COURSE REQUIRED TO BRING THE SERIES 7 BACK IN GOOD STANDING.  A DAY OR TWO AFTER COMPLETING THE CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENT, IT WAS FOUND THAT ROCHDALE HAD NEVER REGISTERED THE SERIES 63 PORTION OF THE SERIES 66 EXAM. THEY HAD ONLY REGISTERED THE SERIES 65 PORTION. THIS WAS A SHOCK TO ME AS I DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE TO REGISTER ONLY ONE OF THE TWO LICENSES AFTER PASSING THE SERIES 66. I THOUGHT THAT PASSING THE SERIES 66 EXAM MEANT THAT I WAS IN GOOD STANDING FROM BOTH A SERIES 63 AND SERIES 65 STANDPOINT.  THE HSBC LEGAL ADVISORS LOOKED INTO THE MATTER AND INITIALLY DECIDED THAT FINRA DID NOT NEED TO BE NOTIFIED AS I WAS FOR THE MOST PART IN GOOD STANDING AND HAD PASSED THE REQUIRED EXAMS. THERE IS AN EMAIL WITH THIS STATEMENT. UNFORTUNATELY THE EMAIL WAS SENT TO MY HSBC EMAIL ADDRESS, WHICH I NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO.  THE HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT DECIDED TO DO THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION AND DECIDED TO LET ME GO AS THEY DID NOT WANT TO TAKE ANY LEGAL RISKS IN THE FACE OF ALL OF THE OTHER REGULATORY ISSUES THAT THEY HAD BEEN FACING.""
