  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS JUDGMENT WAS PLACED ON ME IN REGARDS TO A COURT CASE WHERE I WAS THE PLANTIFF.  I LOST THE COURT CASE AND BECAME RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OTHER PARTY'S COURT COSTS AND LEGAL FEES.  I AGREED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO INDEPENDENT FIRE INSURANCE CO. IN THE AMT OF $100 PER MONTH.  I HAD MADE THREE YEARS OF PAYMENTS WHEN I STARTED RECEIVING MY CHECKS BACK.  AFTER CONTACTING INDEPENDENT FIRE INSURANCE CO. I LEARNED THAT THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS.  I ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THIS AT THAT TIME HOWEVER THE NEW COMPANY WHO PURCHASED INDEPENDENT FIRE INSURANCE HAD NO RECORD OF MY JUDGMENT.  I HAVE PREVIOUSLY CONTACTED AN ATTORNEY WHO WAS UNABLE TO HELP ME REMOVE THIS JUDGMENT FROM COUNTY RECORDS.""
