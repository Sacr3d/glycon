  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE LETTER WRITTEN BY [FAMILY MEMBER] IS RIDDLED WITH MISSTATEMENTS AND UNTRUTHS. [FAMILY MEMBER] IS TRYING TO IMPLY THAT THE PURCHASE OF THE GMAC SMARTNOTES WAS MY RECOMMENDATION. THIS IS NOT TRUE. I HAD NEVER HEARD OF GMAC SMARTNOTES UNTIL [CUSTOMER] BROUGHT THEM TO MY ATTENTION. IT WAS [CUSTOMER] WHO WANTED TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT AND I TOOK THE ORDER FROM [CUSTOMER] ON AN UNSOLICITED BASIS. [FAMILY MEMBER] STATES IN HIS LETTER THAT I ADVISED [CUSTOMERS] ON THE INVESTMENT. THIS IS NOT TRUE. I ADVISED THEM TO HIRE A PROFESSIONAL MONEY MANAGER TO CONSTRUCT A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH YIELDING REIT INVESTMENTS. [CUSTOMER] TOLD ME HE'D RATHER INVEST IN THE GMAC PAPER. AS HE SAID, \""IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO GM WE HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS THEN THESE BONDS.\"" [FAMILY MEMBER] ALSO STATES THE BONDS ARE RISKY. WHEN [CUSTOMER] PLACED THE ORDER THE BONDS WERE A RATED. THE BONDS ALSO CARRY A DEATH PUT SO IF ONE OF THEM DIES THE BONDS ARE PAID OFF AT PAR. ANOTHER MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT THAT [FAMILY MEMBER] MAKES IS THAT 80% OF THE TRUST WAS INVESTED IN THESE BONDS. ACCOUNTS FOR THE TRUST ARE HELD AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FIRMS AND I BELIEVE THE SIZE OF THE TRUST TO BE APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION. [CUSTOMERS] ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED INVESTORS. THEY OWN RAILWAY CARS AND OWNED A COMPANY THAT TRADED SCRAP METAL. THEY WERE VERY AWARE OF MARKETS. I DID BUSINESS WITH THE BROTHERS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND MOST OF THE TRADES WERE FOR $25,000 TO $50,000. WHY WOULD THEY THEN DO A TRADE FOR $1 MILLION? THE REASON THEY DID IT WAS IT WAS THEIR IDEA AND THEY WERE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE TRADE. THE PROBLEM AROSE WHEN THE KIDS GOT INVOLVED. [CUSTOMER] ONCE TOLD ME THAT HE LIKED TO BUY BONDS IN $500,000 INCREMENTS SO I REALLY DIDN'T GIVE IT MUCH THOUGHT WHEN THEY GAVE ME THE ORDER. [FAMILY MEMBER] IS JUST TRYING TO SHAKE DOWN LEHMAN BROTHERS. HE KNOWS AS WELL AS THE TWO [CUSTOMERS] THAT THE TRADE WAS UNSOLICITED. WILLIAM H. METZ""
