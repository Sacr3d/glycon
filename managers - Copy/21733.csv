RESPONDENTS VEHEMENTLY DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE STATEMENT OF CLAIM, AND SETTLED THIS CLAIM TO AVOID THE COST AND UNCERTAINTY OF ARBITRATION.  CONTRARY TO PLAINTIFF'S ALLEGATIONS, HE HAD A DEMONSTRATED HISTORY OF AGGRESSIVE INVESTING, AND THE TRADES AT ISSUE WERE AUTHORIZED AND UNSOLICITED.  CLAIMANT VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW HIS CLAIM AGAINST MR. BIONDO. IN FACT, THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE NEW ACCOUNT COMMODITY DOCUMENTATION ON FILE AND THIS IS WHY THE CLAIM WAS SETTLED.""
