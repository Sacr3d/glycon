  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This is a claim against my former employer, Eplanning Securities, and the claimants' registered representatives regarding transactions that occurred over 12 years ago, for which I have been named as a co-respondent. There are no specific allegations made against me in the statement of claim and the only claims that could conceivably apply to me as the former VP of Operations for Eplanning are those concerning breach of fiduciary duty, and failure to supervise by Eplanning. Such claims, however, are factually inaccurate or erroneous as I was not a director or control person, or involved in or responsible for any of the alleged acts that gave rise to these claims. In addition, many of the alleged activities and transactions took place prior to and after the registered representatives' affiliation with Eplanning, for which I have no knowledge of or involvement in. As noted above the transactions in question also took place over 12 years ago, which is well beyond the statute of limitations. Based on the information outlined above I am pursuing a dismissal from this claim.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The case involved a customer complaint against a former representative of Enplaning in regard to a private real estate investment. I was improperly named as a co-respondent in this case and there were no specific allegations against me. As the former VP of Operations for the Broker/Dealer I never had any dealings with the claimants and was not responsible for any of the activities that gave rise to the claim, which was corroborated during the arbitration hearing. Following an arbitration hearing in November 2011 the claimant received an award of $127, 106 of which less than 5% of the total award was charged against me by the panel without any explanation. Because I was convinced that I was improperly included in the case to begin with and the panel's decision was wrong I joined an action before the California Superior to Court to have the award vacated and corrected. Prior to a hearing on the merits, I agreed to pay the claimant $1,000 in full settlement of the claims against me. I did this solely to avoid the expense of litigation and have maintained that I was improperly included as a co-respondent in the case.""
