  ""Allegations"" : ""The Securities and Exchange Commission (\""Commission\"") alleges that it brings this action to enjoin Vergeous LLC (\""Vergeous\""), Dream Team Partners LLC (\""Dream Team\""), and Paul E. Renfroe (\""Renfroe\"") (collectively, \""Defendants\"") from violations of the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.   From at least June 2013 through June 2016, Vergeous, Dream Team, and Renfroe raised about $1.2 million from approximately 33 investors in Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi, Texas, Indiana, South Carolina, and Alabama through a series of unregistered securities offerings.   The purported purpose of the Vergeous and Dream Team offerings was to fund video game projects undertaken at first by Vergeous and then later by a joint venture between Vergeous and Dream Team. Renfroe was primarily responsible for raising money from investors for both companies. Many of the investors were elderly clients of Renfroe's other business. Renfroe advertised the securities on his radio show and on Vergeous's website.   Vergeous, Dream Team, and Renfroe made misrepresentations and omissions orally and in offering materials distributed to investors regarding: (1) Renfroe's disciplinary history; (2) the purported use of some investor proceeds to pay debt and back pay related to a suspended project; and (3) Dream Team's 100% ownership of intellectual property rights for all of its joint video game projects with Vergeous and Renfroe's ownership stake in Dream Team.   By engaging in this conduct, Defendants violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\""Securities Act\"") and Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act; and Renfroe violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\""Exchange Act\"")."",
