THIS WAS A HIGH LEVEL EMPLOYEE WHO DID NOT TAKE THE TIME TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS THAT HIS COMPANY OFFERED AND THEN, YEARS LATER, LOOKED TO PLACE THE BLAME ON ME BECAUSE HE DID NOT TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE RETIREMENT PLANS OFFERED.  THIS COMES DOWN TO PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY.  HIS CLAIM OF $32,624.55 MOSTLY INCLUDES MONEY THAT HE DIDN'T DEFER AND INVEST IN HIS COMPANY'S RETIREMENT PLANS ($26,073.47 - BUT STILL RECEIVED), AND THE TAX SAVINGS ($6550.79) THAT HE DID NOT RECEIVE.""
