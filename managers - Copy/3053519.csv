  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS IS A US TAX LIEN FOR TAX YEARS 2005.  I WAS TOLD BY THE OFFICE OF THE IRS WHEN I SET UP A PAYMENT AGREEMENT WITH THEM TO PAY THESE TAXES OWED, THAT THEY WOULD NOT FILE A LIEN AGAINST ME UNTIL SUCH TIME AS I WAS DELINQUENT ON THE ARRANGEMENT.  NO SOONER HAD PAYMENTS BEGUN THAN I RECEIVED NOTICE OF THE LIEN IN THE PALM BEACH COUNTY COURT.  LATER I WAS TOLD THAT THE IRS IS STATING THEIR CLAIM AND THIS IS STANDARD PROCEDURE IN THESE CIRCUMSTNANCES.  THERE IS A PAYMENT ARRANGEMENT IN PLACE FOR THIS DEBT AND IT IS CURRENT.  I WAS UNAWARE THAT THIS NEEDED TO BE PLACED ON U4 DOCUMENTATION.  IT CAME TO MY ATTENTION LATE LAST WEEK 9/14/09 AND I AM DOING MY BEST TO BRING THIS INTO COMPLIANCE.  HAD I NONE THAT THIS WAS GOING TO PLAY OUT THE WAY IT DID, I WOULD HAVE SOUGH OTHER ARRANGMENTS TO PAY THESE TAXES.""
