The sanctions are based on findings that Geffner willfully failed to amend his Form U4 to timely report six tax liens and one bankruptcy. Geffner was subject at various times to a bankruptcy and six tax liens totaling over $300,000. The findings stated that Geffner also made false attestations to his employer on annual compliance certification questionnaires in which he represented that he had not incurred any unsatisfied judgments or liens against him since completing his prior certification. Because Geffner's misconduct was willful, and the information he failed to disclose was material, he is subject to statutory disqualification. The decision is final September 29, 2016.""
