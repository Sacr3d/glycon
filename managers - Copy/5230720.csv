I INFORMED THE CUSTOMERS OF THE ISSUE AS SOON AS I WAS AWARE OF IT. WHEN THEY WERE INFORMED OF THE (SECURITIES RELATED) ISSUE THEY WERE ALREADY UPSET DUE TO A \""NON-SECURITIES\"" TRANSACTION. AT THIS TIME THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE WORKING WITH SOMEONE ELSE AND THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ME TO CALL THEN AGAIN, AS REFERENCED IN THEIR COMPLAINT.""
