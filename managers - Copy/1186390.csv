  ""Allegations"" : ""[CUSTOMERS] OPENED THREE DISCRETIONARY FEE-BASED ACCOUNTS AND DEPOSITED APPROXIMATELY $2,000,000 IN CASH AND SECURITIES WITH WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY IN DECEMBER 2001.  IN FEBRUARY 2004, [CUSTOMER] COMPLAINED THAT THE ACCOUNTS HAD UNDERPERFORMED THE MARKET.  HE QUESTIONED THE SUITABILITY OF THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY AS HE NEARED RETIREMENT. IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE [CUSTOMERS] FILED AN ARBITRATION CLAIM AGAINST WILLIAM BLAIR AND MARK FULLER. IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE ARBITRATION CLAIM WAS SETTLED TO AVOID THE INCONVENIENCE AND EXPENSE OF LITIGATION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT, THE [CUSTOMERS] WERE PAID $100,000. MR. FULLER DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SETTLEMENT, WHICH WAS PAID IN FULL BY WILLIAM BLAIR."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE [CUSTOMER'S] CLAIM ARE COMPLETLY WITHOUT MERIT.  WHEN THE ACCOUNTS WERE TRANSFERRED TO ME, THEY WERE CONCENTRATED IN NINE LARGE CAP STOCKS.  I INCREASED THE NUMBER OF STOCKS IN THE PORTFOLIO AND BROADENED THE MARKET CAP RANGE.  THE ASSET ALLOCATION WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS WHEN THE ACCOUNTS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE FIRM.  ALTHOUGH [CUSTOMER] COMPLAINS THAT HIS ACCOUNTS WERE UNNECESSARILY EXPOSED TO RISK, HE FAILS TO MENTION THAT WHEN THEY WERE TRANSFERRED TO ME, HE EXPRESSED HIS UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ACCOUNTS NEEDED TO GROW TO ACHIEVE HIS RETIREMENT GOALS (HE PLANNED TO RETIRE IN 2 YEARS) AND THAT EQUITIES WOULD BE THE PRIMARY MEANS OF THAT GROWTH.  WE MET REGULARLY DURING THE TIME WE WORKED TOGETHER AND WE DISCUSSED THE STRATEGY EMPLOYED FOR THE ACCOUNTS.  THIS CLAIM WAS ABOUT PERFORMANCE, RATHER THAN DIVERSIFICATION OR SUITABILITY.  IT WAS SETTLED SOLELY TO AVOID THE INCONVENIENCE AND EXPENSE OF LITIGATION.""
