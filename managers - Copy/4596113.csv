  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Pope consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he engaged in an outside business activity outside the scope of his employment with his member firm. The findings stated that Pope attempted to secure a buyer for 10 sellers of Iraqi Dinar currency in anticipation of a finder's fee. Pope had a company established in order to conduct this activity and used his personal email address to communicate with the sellers and potential buyers about the potential terms of a sale. Pope also conducted due diligence on potential buyers, prepared transaction-related documentation, and made arrangements to facilitate a potential currency sale. Pope did not notify the firm about this outside business activity. The findings also stated that Pope stated on a firm annual compliance form that he agreed to notify the firm about any outside business activity. However, Pope did not notify the firm about his outside business activity."",
