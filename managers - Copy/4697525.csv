  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN 2006 I PURCHASED AN INVESTMENT PROPERTY IN GEORGETOWN, SC WITH A BALLOON PAYMENT MORTGAGE, PLANNING ON SELLING IN LESS THAN 3 YRS. WHEN THE BALLOON CAME DUE THE PROPERTY COULDN'T BE SOLD AS IT WAS ONLY WORTH 1/10TH OF WHAT I PURCHASED IT FOR. I TRIED TO GET A RE-MODIFICATION ON THE LOAN BUT THE MORTGAGE CO. DIDN'T WANT TO BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE REDUCTION ON PROPERTY VALUE (AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT A 90% PAYDOWN ON THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE, WHICH I DIDN'T HAVE). WHEN THEY SUBSEQUENTLY ASKED FOR THE PAYMENT IN FULL I DIDN'T HAVE THAT EITHER SO NOW THE MORTGAGE CO HAS PUT A JUDGMENT AGAINST ME FOR VALUE OF THE LOAN. I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THEM RECENTLY TRYING TO WORK OUT A PAYMENT ARRANGEMENT AND THEY ARE STILL STICKING TO A PAYMENT IN FULL.   I DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE PAYMENT IN FULL HOWEVER I AM STILL CONTACTING TO SEE IF THEY WILL LISTEN TO REASON AND ALLOW SOME KIND OF PAYMENT PLAN THAT IS AFFORDABLE.   THE EXTENT OF THE OUTSTANDING JUDGMENT/LIEN ON MY CREDIT REPORT IS DUE TO THIS ONE PROPERTY. I REGRETTABLY KNOW THAT THIS LEAN CAN AND WILL AFFECT THE CHOICE OF SOME INSURANCE COMPANIES TO APPOINTMENT ME, HOWEVER I HOPE THAT YOU VIEW THIS NOT AS A DETERMINE FACTOR, AS I TYPICALLY HAVE BEEN ON TIME WITH ALL OF MY OTHER OBLIGATIONS AND EVEN WITH THE LIEN MY CREDIT SCORE IS STILL IN DECENT STANDING.  I MADE ALL OF THE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS ON THE INVESTMENT PROPERTY ON TIME, AND IF THE MORTGAGE COMPANY WOULD HAVE WORKED TO RE-MODIFY THE LOAN WHEN IT CAME DUE I COULD HAVE KEPT THE PAYMENTS UP, HOWEVER, AGAIN THEY REFUSED TO DO SO WITHOUT A LARGE DOWN PAYMENT WHICH I DO NOT HAVE.""
