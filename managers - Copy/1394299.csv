  ""Allegations"" : ""WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, GIBSON CONSENTED TO THE SANCTION AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT HE IMPROPERLY USED CUSTOMER FUNDS WHEN HE MISUSED TWO POWERS OF ATTORNEY TO TRANSFER APPROXIMATELY $60,000 FROM HIS MOTHER'S INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) AT HIS MEMBER FIRM TO HER PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNT AT A BANK, AND FROM THERE, WRONGFULLY WITHDREW THE FUNDS FOR HIS PERSONAL USE. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT ALTHOUGH THE POWERS OF ATTORNEY INCLUDED PROVISIONS ALLOWING THE ATTORNEY-IN-FACT, GIBSON, TO MAKE GIFTS, INCLUDING TO HIMSELF, THE APPLICABLE LAW PROVIDES THAT THOSE GIFTS MUST BE MADE WITH THE UTMOST GOOD FAITH AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS MOTHER'S HISTORY OF PERSONAL GIVING. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT GIBSON'S WITHDRAWALS FROM HIS MOTHER'S ACCOUNT WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH HER HISTORY OF PERSONAL GIVING. GIBSON REPAID THE FUNDS AFTER HIS IMPROPER USE WAS DISCOVERED."",
