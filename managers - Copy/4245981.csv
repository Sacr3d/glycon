  ""Allegations"" : ""A CUSTOMER ALLEGED THAT KATE KINNIS DID NOT FULLY ADVISE THE CUSTOMER THAT A 9/2/10 TRANSFER OF THE CUSTOMER'S METLIFE IRA ANNUITY TO THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT IN A 403(B) THRIFT PLAN (\""PLAN\"") AT KINNIS' EMPLOYER, MUTUAL, WOULD RESULT IN A SURRENDER FEE AND LOSS OF FINANCIAL BENEFITS INCLUDING A GUARANTEED MINIMUM INCOME BASE. ON 8/14/10, THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE (\""RR\""), WHO IS A SALARIED NON-COMMISSIONED MUTUAL EMPLOYEE, PROVIDED A GROUP PRESENTATION TO EMPLOYEES OF THE CUSTOMER'S EMPLOYER ON THE BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO THEM UNDER THE PLAN OFFERED BY THE EMPLOYER AND FUNDED BY A MUTUAL GROUP VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT. AT THE REQUEST OF THE CUSTOMER, THE RR MET WITH THE CUSTOMER ON 8/24/10 TO DISCUSS THE PLAN. THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED THE RR WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CUSTOMER'S METLIFE IRA AND OLD MUTUAL ROTH IRA. THE CUSTOMER ADVISED THAT SHE WAS PLANNING ON RETIRING WITHIN A YEAR AND THAT SHE DID NOT WANT HER INVESTMENTS SPREAD ALL OVER DIFFERENT PROVIDERS AND EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN CONSOLIDATING HER INVESTMENTS AT MUTUAL. THE PAPERWORK PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER INDICATED THAT SHE HAD A METLIFE IRA. THE RR ASKED THE CUSTOMER IF SHE WOULD INCUR A SURRENDER CHARGE ON THE METLIFE IRA AND THE CUSTOMER SAID SHE DID NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS A SURRENDER CHARGE. ALSO, IN PAPERWORK COMPLETED BY THE CUSTOMER REGARDING THE ROTH IRA, SHE INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO SURRENDER CHARGES. THE CUSTOMER ELECTED TO ROLLOVER HER METLIFE IRA TO THE PLAN AND HER OLD MUTUAL ROTH IRA TO A MUTUAL ROTH IRA AND COMPLETED THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION TO COMPLETE BOTH TRANSFERS. IT IS NOTED THAT NEITHER THE PLAN NOR MUTUAL IRA HAS FRONT END CHARGES OR SURRENDER FEES. PRIOR TO THE TRANSFER OF THE OLD MUTUAL ROTH IRA, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT SURRENDER CHARGES WOULD APPLY, AND THE RR DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSACTION WOULD NOT BE SUITABLE. AS A RESULT, THE ROLLOVER OF THE ROTH IRA WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED. THE METLIFE IRA WAS TRANSFERRED ON 9/2/10. (IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE CUSTOMER ALLEGED THAT THE MEETING WITH THE RR AND THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS OCCURRED IN 05/2010. MUTUAL RECORDS CLEARLY SHOW THAT THE MEETING AND TRANSFER OCCURRED ON THE ABOVE AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER DATES.) SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FINANCIAL ADVISER WHO HAD ORIGINALLY PUT THE CUSTOMER, WHO IS OVER AGE 70, INTO THE METLIFE IRA IN 2007 ADVISED THAT A SURRENDER CHARGE APPLIED TO THE METLIFE IRA AND THAT IT HAD A GUARANTEED MINIMUM INCOME BASE THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN 2017. THE CUSTOMER AND MUTUAL SOUGHT TO REVERSE THE TRANSACTION AND RETURN HER FUNDS TO THE METLIFE IRA. MUTUAL PROMPTLY SENT THE APPROPRIATE PAPERWORK TO THE CUSTOMER'S EMPLOYER, AS REQUIRED. THE EMPLOYER WAS ALSO INSTRUCTED TO COMPLETE AND CERTIFY THE WITHDRAWAL FORM AND THEN FORWARD THE FORMS TO THE CUSTOMER TO COMPLETE AND SIGN THE WITHDRAWAL REQUEST AND RETURN THE FORMS TO MUTUAL. THE CUSTOMER RECEIVED THE FORMS AND FORWARDED THEM TO HER FINANCIAL ADVISOR. THE ADVISOR TELEPHONED THE RR'S SUPERVISOR, CHRISTOPHER CONWAY, AND REQUESTED INFORMATION TO ASSIST IN COMPLETING THE FORMS. MR. CONWAY PROVIDED THE REQUESTED ASSISTANCE. THE COMPLETED FORMS WERE NEVER RETURNED TO MUTUAL TO REVERSE THE TRANSACTION. CUSTOMER ALSO ALLEGES THAT THE RR ADVISED HER TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDS TO A PARTICULAR INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVE UNDER THE PLAN. THAT ALLEGATION IS NOT TRUE. THE CUSTOMER HAD BEEN AUTOMATICALLY ENROLLED IN THE PLAN'S QUALIFIED DEFAULT INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVE SINCE 5/13/10, AND THE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED ACCORDING TO THOSE ALLOCATION INSTRUCTIONS WHICH WERE ON FILE. THERE WERE OTHER INACCURACIES IN HER COMPLAINT INCLUDING HER CLAIM THAT THE RR HAD AGREED TO CONTACT THE CUSTOMER'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR BEFORE SUBMITTING THE ROLLOVER REQUEST FORM TO METLIFE. THE RR DID NOT AGREE TO THIS, AND MOREOVER, THE CUSTOMER NEVER PROVIDED THE RR ANY CONTACT INFORMATION OF THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR. SHE ALSO ALLEGED THAT THE TRANSACTION TOOK PLACE WITHIN AN HOUR OF THE MEETING WITH THE RR IN 05/2010. IN FACT, THE MEETING WAS ON 8/24/10 AND THE TRANSACTION OCCURRED ON 9/2/10."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""WHEN THE CUSTOMER CONTACTED THE COMPANY REGARDING THE SURRENDER FEES AND LOSS OF FINANCIAL BENEFITS INCLUDING A GUARANTEED INCOME BASE UNDER HER METLIFE IRA ANNUITY, THE CUSTOMER REQUESTED A REVERSAL OF THE ROLLOVER TRANSACTION TO OCCUR WITHIN A 60 DAY PERIOD OF WHICH AFTERWARDS METLIFE WOULD NOT ACCEPT A REVERSAL.  THE COMPANY WROTE TO THE EMPLOYER, THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR OF THE PLAN, ADVISING THEM OF THE TRANSFER REQUEST AND PROVIDING THEM WITH THE NECESSARY FORMS THAT THEY, AS PLAN ADMINISTRATOR, MUST COMPLETE.  THE EMPLOYER WAS ALSO INSTRUCTED TO COMPLETE AND CERTIFY THE WITHDRAWAL FORM AND THEN FORWARD THE FORMS TO THE CUSTOMER FOR HER TO COMPLETE AND SIGN THE WITHDRAWAL REQUEST AND RETURN THE FORMS TO THE COMPANY.  THE CUSTOMER RECEIVED THE FORMS AND FORWARDED THEM TO HER FINANCIAL ADVISOR.  THE ADVISOR TELEPHONED MR. CONWAY AND REQUESTED INFORMATION TO ASSIST IN COMPLETING THE FORMS.  MR. CONWAY PROVIDED THE REQUESTED ASSISTANCE.  HOWEVER,  COMPLETED FORMS WERE NEVER RETURNED TO THE COMPANY TO REVERSE THE TRANSACTION.  SINCE THE 60 DAY PERIOD EXPIRED AND METLIFE WOULD NO LONGER ACCEPT THE REVERSAL, THE COMPANY SETTLED THE MATTER TO THE CUSTOMER'S SATISFACTION.""
