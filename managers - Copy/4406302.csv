  ""Broker Comment"" : ""[CUSTOMER] HAS BEEN A CLIENT FOR 10+ YEARS AND RETIRED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA, SOLD HIS HOME IN GAINESVILLE AND MOVED TO TALLAHASSEE TO BE CLOSER TO HIS SON AND GRANDCHILDREN.  [CUSTOMERS] DROVE TO GAINESVILLE IN 2012 TO DISCUSS OPENING AN ACCOUNT WITH SOME AFTER-TAX RMD DOLLARS THAT WERE BEING DISTRIBUTED FROM OTHER VALIC ACCOUNTS.  UPON DISCUSSING AND NQDA ACCOUNT, THE SUBJECT OF A SURRENDER FEE ON THE NEW ACCOUNT WAS DISCUSSED.  THIS WAS NOT A PROBLEM TO THEM, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THEY HAD LARGE AMOUNT OF ASSETS IN OTHER PLACES AND THE FUNDS WERE BEING DEPOSITED LONG-TERM AND FOR PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL.  THE ACCOUNT WAS OPENED AND A DISCLOSURE FORM INDICATING THE SURRENDER FEES AND THE OBJECTIVES OF THE INVESTMENT WAS SIGNED.  THEY ALSO ASKED IF OTHER PERSONAL FUNDS COULD BE ADDED TO THE ACCOUNT AND THEY WERE TOLD YES, AND THE SAME SURRENDER PENALTIES APPLIED. HE THEN MADE A LARGE DEPOSIT FROM THE FUNDS OF THE SALE OF THEIR GAINESVILLE HOUSE, MONEY THAT HAD BEEN INVESTED IN A CREDIT UNION AND HAD BEEN EARNING LESS THAN 0.5% FOR QUITE A WHILE.  WITH A LARGER DEPOSIT, HE WAS ABLE TO GET A BONUS ON THE FIRST YEAR'S INTEREST RATE, AND HE ALSO LIKED THE FACT THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DIVERSIFY SOME INTO THE MARKET, SOMETHING HE WAS UNABLE TO DO WITH THE MONEY IN THE BANK.  HE STILL WANTED A GOOD PORTION (40%) OF THE FUNDS IN A FIXED ACCOUNT WITH BONUS, BUT SAID HE WOULD DIVERSIFY THE REST.  60% WAS PUT INTO SHORT-TERM FIXED AND PORTFOLIO RECOMMENDATIONS WERE GIVEN TO HIM.  HE LEFT WITH THE INTENTION OF RESEARCHING THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND DIVERSIFYING THE ACCOUNT HIMSELF ONLINE.  THE FOLLOWING YEAR HE CALLED AND WAS UPSET THAT, ALTHOUGH THE INTEREST RATES WERE HIGHER THAN WHAT HE HAD BEEN GETTING IN THE BANK, THEY WERE NOT COMPARABLE TO THE MARKET RETURNS HE WAS GETTING IN OTHER INVESTMENTS.  I REMINDED HIM OF WHY HE OPENED THE ACCOUNT AND MENTIONED THAT SOME OF THE FUNDS WERE STILL IN SHORT-TERM FIXED AS HE HAD NOT REALLOCATED HIS ACCOUNT.  AT THAT TIME HE AGAIN ASKED FOR, AND RECEIVED, THREE DIFFERENT DIVERSIFICATION RECOMMENDATION MODELS.  AGAIN, HE DID NOTHING WITH THE PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION, BUT INSTEAD INITIATED A REQUEST TO MOVE THE FUNDS TO ANOTHER CARRIER.  A SHORT TIME LATER, AFTER BEING NOTIFIED BY THE ASSET RETENTION TEAM THAT HE WANTED TO MOVE THE MONEY TO AN ADVISOR HE HAD BEGUN WORKING WITH IN TALLAHASSEE, I CALLED AND WE SPOKE AGAIN.  HE WAS STILL UPSET AT THE RETURNS FROM HIS SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATE COMPARED TO THE 15-20% VARIABLE RETURNS HE HAD BEEN RECEIVING FROM HIS OTHER INVESTMENTS.  I AGAIN WENT OVER THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO MOVE SOME INTO THE MARKET AND ALSO REMINDED HIM THAT MOVING THE MONEY OUT OF VALIC WOULD RESULT IN SURRENDER FEES. AT THAT TIME, HE STOPPED THE ROLLOUT REQUEST, BUT DID SEND A LETTER COMPLAINING THAT THE SURRENDER FEES HAD NOT BEEN MENTIONED AND REQUESTING TO HAVE THEM REMOVED.  AS OF NOW, HE HAS STILL NOT MOVED THE MONEY FROM VALIC. AFTER REVIEWING NOTES AND SIGNED FORMS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT [CUSTOMER] HAD BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE SURRENDER FEES AT THE TIME OF OPENING THE NEW ACCOUNT AND HIS REQUEST WAS DENIED. VALIC'S FILING MADE IT VERY APPARENT THAT THEY FOUND NO WRONGDOING ON MY PART AND THAT THE COMPLAINT WAS DENIED IN ITS ENTIRETY.""
