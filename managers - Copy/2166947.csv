  ""Broker Comment"" : ""PER PRUCO SECURITIES, LLC \""THIS CONCERNS A POLICY INCLUDED IN THE CLASS OF POLICIES THAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF A NATIONWIDE CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT IN WHICH PRUDENTIAL, ITS INSURANCE AFFILIATES AND PERSONNEL WERE RELEASED CONCERNING LIFE INSURANCE SALES PRACTICES. THE CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT REMEDIATION PROCESSES FOR ADDRESSING CLAIMS FOR POLICIES INCLUDED IN THE CLASS HAVE CONCLUDED. BECAUSE THE COMPANY AND THE REPRESENTATIVE(S) WERE RELEASED FROM ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OR OBLIGATION WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS LIKE THOSE MADE BY THE POLICYHOLDER, THE COMPANY IS NOT REVIEWING THIS INQUIRY AND IS MAKING NO FINDING OR FURTHER FILING REGARDING THIS INQUIRY.\""  This is a repeat complaint (previously reported) from the same individual who accused me approximately 17 years ago along with an attorney downstairs from my office (a former Judge) and Key Bank, of forged signatures regarding her mother's durable power of attorney paperwork after the mother went into the nursing home.   The matter was previously reviewed by Prudential, The Ohio Department of Insurance, and FINRA.  The complaint was denied by Prudential after which the individual went on to harass me for at least 5 years thereafter, leaving threatening messages a few times a week, at which point I made the local authorities aware of it and sought a protection order.   At the end of the hearing she submitted paperwork that supposedly had her mother's signature on it.  The judge made her aware that what she was submitting was in no way similar to the signatures that he had on file for her mother, and I was granted a 5 year protection order.  She continues to write letters to the local newspaper accusing me of wrongdoing and calling me every name in the book. It looks like something is being said regarding Prudential's remediation that also took place many years ago and of course does not apply in this case or complaint.  Prudential is not recognizing it, nor responding to it either.  I think it's ridiculous that people can bring up not only things that are untrue, but do so more than once and I have to defend myself over and over again.""
