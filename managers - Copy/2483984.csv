ON 1/8/86 I APPEARED INCOURT WITH COUNSEL AND THE COURT AFTER HAVING REVIEWED THE CHARGES ADJOURNED THEM FOR DISMISSAL.  IF NO SUBSEQUENT OFFENSES OCCURRED DURING THE NEXT SIX MONTHS THE COURT ADVISED THAT THE INCIDENT WOULD BE DROPPED FROM MY PERMANENT RECORD AND THE INFORMATION IN THE FILE SEALED.  BASED ON THE ABOVE AND THAT IN THE LAST NINE PLUS YEARS, THIS MATTER HAD NOT SURFACED; I DID NOT REPORT THE INCIDENT.""
