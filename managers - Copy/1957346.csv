  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I EXECUTED MARKET ORDERS FOR SEVERAL INTERNET STOCKS EXACTLY AS REQUESTED BY CLIENT.  THE RISKY INTERNET STOCKS HE BOUGHT OPENED HIGHER THAN HE ANTICIPATED CAUSING A DEFICIT IN HIS ACCOUNT.  WITH FULL AUTHORIZATION FROM CLIENT, ENOUGH SHARES OF STOCK WERE SOLD TO CLEAR DEBIT IN CLIENT'S ACCOUNT.  THE NET RESULT OF THE TRADES EXECUTED WAS A LOSS TO THE CLIENT.  THE CLIENT ADMITTED TO ME HE MADE A MISTAKE, BUT WANTS ME TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS LOSS.  I DENY ANY CLAIMS OF WRONG DOING AND HOLD FAST TO THE TRUTH THAT I FOLLOWED CLIENT'S INSTRUCTIONS TO HIS SPECIFIC REQUESTS. I DO NOT HAVE RECORDED LINES IN MY OFFICE WHICH HAS LEFT ME VULNERABLE TO ATTACK FROM CLIENTS WHO REFUSE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ERRORS.  I EXPLICITLY FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO ME BY MY CLIENT AND I AM INNOCENT OF ANY ALLEGATIONS.""
