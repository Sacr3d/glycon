  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I PLED ALFORD.  IN AN ALFORD PLEA, THE DEFENDANT DOES NOT ADMIT THE ACT, BUT ADMITS THAT THE PROSECUTION COULD LIKELY PROVE THE CHARGE.  (NORTH CAROLINA V ALFORD) AT THE TIME I WAS ATTENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER. ONE DAY I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK. I STOPPED IN A BICYCLE SHOP ACROSS THE STREET TO SAY HELLO TO ONE OF MY FRIENDS AND THEN CONTINUED DOWN THE ALLEY TOWARDS THE NEXT STREET WHERE I WORKED. ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS THE WAY DOWN THE ALLEY A COP CAR PULLED UP BEHIND ME AND ARRESTED ME. . . THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME WHAT THE CHARGES WERE OR WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEY ONLY MENTIONED THAT IT WAS DRUG RELATED, SO AT THE TIME I WAS IN DISBELIEF AND HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT. I WAS TAKEN TO THE POLICE STATION AND SEARCHED, WHERE NOTHING WAS FOUND, NO MONEY(MARKED BILLS), NO DRUGS, NO NOTHING. TALKING TO AN OFFICER WHILE AT THE POLICE STATION, SHE WAS THE ONE THAT HAD LET ME KNOW THAT, APPARENTLY IN THE TIME THAT I WAS WALKING TO WORK WITH MY FRIEND, I HAD SOLD DRUGS TO AN UNDERCOVER AGENT. . .OBVIOUSLY THIS WAS A CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY. I WAS THEN LET GO THAT NIGHT ON A PROMISSORY BOND. I WAS THEN ASSIGNED A PUBLIC DEFENDER AND WENT TO COURT FOR A PRE-TRIAL HEARING. BEFORE DOING ANYTHING, THEY OFFERED A PLEA BARGAIN. . THE PLEA BARGAIN ENTAILED ME TO 18 MONTHS DEFERRED SENTENCE WHERE WHEN THAT WAS COMPLETED, THE CHARGE WOULD THEN BE ERASED FROM MY RECORD. CURRENTLY IT HASN'T BEEN ERASED BUT FROM MY UNDERSTANDING, IT HAS NO CHARGE OF GUILT OR INNOCENCE, AND I AM ABLE TO GET A 'PETITION TO SEAL' THE CHARGE.   THIS IS MY SIDE OF THE STORY, AND I STRONGLY STAND BEHIND IT. MICHAEL STRASNER""
