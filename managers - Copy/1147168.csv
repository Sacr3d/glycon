  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CLIENTS WERE INTRODUCED TO ME THRU A JOINT MEETING WITH THE BRANCH MANAGER, A LICENSED BANKER (LB), AND ALSO SELLS INVESTMENTS.  THE CLIENTS SAW AN AD IN THE PAPER FOR 4% ON CD'S.  BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS THAT LB HAD WITH THEM, HE ASKED ME TO MEET WITH EVERYBODY TO DISCUSS ALTERNATIVES.  THE CLIENTS STATED THEY DID NOT HAVE A NEED FOR THIS PORTION OF THEIR FUNDS AND WANTED THE OPTION OF EARNING A STRONGER RETURN.  IT WAS EXPLAINED CLEARLY THAT THIS WAS A LONG TERM COMMITMENT AND THEY STATED IT WAS FOR THE ESTATE ANYWAY AND THE FUNDS WERE NOT NEEDED FOR ANY IMMEDIATE NEED.  THEY KNEW THIS WAS AN ANNUITY BASED ON ALL THE QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND SIGNED PAPERWORK.  ALL ILLUSTRATIONS AND PROSPECTUSES WERE GIVEN.  THE CLIENT HAD TEN DAYS TO CANCEL THE ANNUITY UPON RECEIVING THE CONTRACT WHICH CLEARLY STATED THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  I DO NOT BENEFIT IN ANY WAY ON WHICH THE CLIENT CHOOSES FOR BENEFICIARIES.  KEYBANK HAS AN AGE CAP FOR VARIABLE ANNUITIES FOR CLIENTS AGE 80 OR OVER.  WIFE WANTED TO BUY THE ANNUITY AND STATED TO JUST PUT THE CONTRACT IN HER NAME BECAUSE SHE WAS AGE 79 AT THAT TIME.""
