GERACI ASSISTED THE CUSTOMER IN COMPLETING THE NECESSARY FORMS TO EFFECT THE PURCHASE.  THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM (PPM) STATED THAT THE NOTES HAD NOT BEEN AND WOULD NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. IT ALSO STATED THAT THE NOTES INVOLVED A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK AND THAT THE NOTES WERE SUITABLE ONLY FOR PERSONS OF SUBSTANTIAL NET WORTH WHO HAD THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE A HIGH-RISK ILLIQUID INVESTMENT AND COULD \""BEAR THE RISK OF A COMPLETE LOSS OF THEIR INVESTMENT.\"" IN RECOMMENDING TO THE CUSTOMER THAT SHE PURCHASE A NOTE, AND IN CAUSING THE NOTE PURCHASE TO BE EFFECTED ON HER BEHALF, GERACI DID NOT HAVE REASONABLE GROUNDS TO BELIEVE THAT A NOTE WAS SUITABLE FOR THE CUSTOMER BASED ON FACTS AND INFORMATION KNOWN TO HIM. THE NOTE WAS NOT SUITABLE FOR THE CUSTOMER BECAUSE THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NOTE WERE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH HER INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES OR WITH HER FINANCIAL NEEDS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. HER PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES WERE TO GENERATE INCOME TO PAY HER MONTHLY EXPENSES AND TO HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE IF SHE WERE TO NEED LONG-TERM CARE. HER RISK PROFILE WAS CONSERVATIVE. THE COMPANY THAT ISSUED THE SECURITY DEFAULTED ON THE NOTES, WHICH ARE NOW EFFECTIVELY WORTHLESS AND THE CUSTOMER SUSTAINED A COMPLETE LOSS OF HER $50,000 INVESTMENT."",
