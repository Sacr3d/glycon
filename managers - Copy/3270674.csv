  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I PREVIOUSLY OWNED A HOME IN CHARLOTTE, NC THAT WAS SOLD IN 2003 WHEN I MOVED TO AUSTIN, TX. WHEN THE HOME WAS SOLD, HOWEVER, UNBEKNOWNST TO ME A SECOND MORTGAGE WAS NOT PAID OFF AT THE TIME OF CLOSING.  MY NOW EX-WIFE AND THEN CURRENT WIFE PAID THE HOUSEHOLD BILLS AND CONTINUED TO MAKE THE MONTHLY PAYMENT ON THAT SECOND MORTGAGE, AGAIN UNBEKNOWNST TO ME.  AT SOME POINT AFTER OUR DIVORCE IN 2007 SHE STOPPED MAKING THOSE MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON THAT SECOND MORTGAGE, AGAIN UNBEKNOWNST TO ME, LEADING TO THE LENDER TAKING STEPS TO FORECLOSE UPON THE CURRENT OWNER (ARON STRAUSE). AS A RESULT OF THAT STRAUSE TOOK STEPS TO HAVE THE REFERENCED JUDGMENT ENTERED INTO.  THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING I WAS AWARE EXISTING UNTIL FINRA'S REQUEST FOR MORE INFORMATION BROUGHT IT TO MY ATTENTION. I HAVE MADE A SETTLEMENT WITH COMMONWEALTH TITLE COMPANY AND AM CURRENTLY PAYING $500 PER MONTH TOWARDS A REDUCED BALANCE OF $25,000.""
