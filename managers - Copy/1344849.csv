  ""Initiated By"" : ""FINRA"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Espinoza consented to the sanction and to the entry of findings that he engaged in an outside business activity without disclosing this activity to his member firm.  The findings stated that Espinoza incorporated a company that was operated by him, and he obtained investors who collectively invested more than $325,000 with the company, and in return for their investments, which were undocumented, Espinoza orally agreed to pay them an annual or semi-annual payment equaling 5.25% of their invested principal. Espinoza is unable to account for substantial amounts of the funds he raised from the investors, and he is not currently able to pay the principal back and has no credible plans for doing so. The findings also stated Espinoza failed to disclose outside brokerage accounts he controlled at two third-party FINRA member firms. Espinoza opened a brokerage account on behalf of the company at a third-party FINRA member firm, on which he was the authorized trader and agent, and he made 84 securities trades in this account totaling $417,505. Espinoza also deposited many of the funds raised from the company's investors into this account, and subsequently transferred most of the deposited funds to accounts at two unaffiliated banks, from which he took purported \""loans\"" that were undocumented and with no fixed terms to fund personal expenses or otherwise spent the funds on the company's behalf. Espinoza also opened a master brokerage account for the company at a second third-party FINRA member firm, and he also opened subaccounts under the company's master account for individual customers, many of whom were also his customers at his member firm. Espinoza had full trading authority in these subaccounts, and used that authority to perform more than 40 securities transactions totaling approximately $1.5 million on behalf of the subaccount owners, and charged a total of $15,195 in commissions for performing those securities transactions. Espinoza conducted this securities business through the second-third party firm instead of his firm in part to circumvent a wage garnishment in place at the firm related to a civil judgment obtained against him by a former business partner. On the application paperwork Espinoza completed to open the company's accounts with the third-party firms, he falsely represented through omission that he was not affiliated with a F1NRA member firm, and also falsely indicated that he was not registered as an employee of a securities brokerage firm when in fact he was registered with such a firm. The findings also included that Espinoza willfully failed to disclose on his Form U4 reportable tax liens that remain unsatisfied and a civil judgment obtained by a former business partner against him in connection with a dispute over their joint insurance-making business. FINRA found that Espinoza also made misrepresentations on compliance questionnaires submitted to his firm in which he indicated and/or certified that he had disclosed to the firm all of his outside business activities, outside securities accounts, or on certain questionnaires, liens and judgments against him. However, these compliance questionnaires, and Espinoza's related certifications, were false because he had not disclosed his outside business company, his involvement with the brokerage accounts at the third-party FINRA member firms, or the liens and judgments against him. FINRA also found that Espinoza failed to respond to several requests for documents and information, failed to provide timely responses to certain other requests outright, and provided false information in response to one request."",
