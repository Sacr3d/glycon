  ""Broker Comment"" : ""AFTER MY DEPARTURE FROM A PRIOR FIRM,MULTIPLE CLIENTS REQUESTED MY ASSISTANCE IN TRANSFERRING THEIR FUNDS TO MY CURRENT FIRM. ACTING ON MY CLIENTS' BEHALF AND ONLY AFTER THEY AUTHORIZED THE TRANSFERS AND SUBMITTED TRANSFER FORMS, I ASSISTED THEM IN THE TRANSFER OF THEIR ASSETS. DURING THE ENTIRE TRANSFER PROCESS, THE ONLY CONCERNS EVER VOICED BY MY CLIENTS WERE RELATED TO HOW LONG IT WAS TAKING MY PRIOR FIRM TO TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS TO MY CURRENT FIRM. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS RELATED TO THE TRANSFERS AND MY CLIENTS WERE GRAVELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF MY PRIOR FIRM AND THE SAFETY OF THEIR INVESTMENTS.  AS SUCH, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE TO TRANSFER THE FUNDS FROM MY PRIOR FIRM.""
