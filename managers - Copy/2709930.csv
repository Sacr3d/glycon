  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS ORIGINALLY LICENSE WITH ALLMERICA FINANCIAL.  I LEFT ALLMERICA IN MARCH 1996 & SIGNED A BROKER'S CONTRACT WITH PROVIDENT MUTUAL & 1717 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT THROUGH AGENCY 45 IN ATLANTA.  IF FILED A  LETTER TO THE GEORGIA INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE, OUTLINING THE MOVE ALONG WITH MY NEW BUSINESS ADDRESS, WITH ELIZABETH ABBOT, THE LICENSING & NEW BUSINESS MANAGER FOR AGENCY 45.  IN NOVEMBER 1996, MS. ABBOT REQUESTED SIGNATURE AND CHECKS FOR MY LICENSE RENEWAL, WHICH I PAID WITH A CHECK TO 1717 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT.  UNBEKNOWST TO ME, THIS ONLY COVERED MY SECURITIES LICENSE RENEWAL (IT WAS MY FIRST YEAR IN THE BUSINESS AND I HAD NEVER HAD TO RENEW MY LICENSE BEFORE).  APPARENTLY, MS. ABBOT WHO LEFT THE AGENCY SHORTLY THEREAFTER, NEVER PROCESS MY LETTER OF NOTIFICATION AND CHANGE OF ADDRESS FROM ALLMERICA FINANCIAL TO PROVIDENT MUTUAL AND 1717 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT.  BECAUSE OF THIS, ALL OF MY INSURANCE LICENSE RENEWAL NOTICES FROM THE GEORGIA INSURANCE DEPARTMENT'S OFFICE WERE MAILED TO ALLMERICA FINANCIAL; THE KIND PEOPLE AT ALLMERICA NEVER FORWARDED ANY OF THE RENEWAL NOTICES TO ME.  I WAS INITIALLY MADE AWARE OF MY LICENSE'S DELINQUENCY WHEN I RECEIVED A CANCELLATION NOTICE FROM 1717 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN SEPTEMBER, 1997, WHICH REVOKED MY SECURITIES LICENSE BECAUSE MY INSURANCE LICENSE HAD EXPIRED.  I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE GEORGIA INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE TO BEGIN THE REINSTATEMENT PROCESS, WHICH TOOK 5 MONTHS.  MY LICENSE WAS REINSTATED ON FEBRUARY 16, 1998 WITH A $150 FINE FOR FAILURE TO TIMELY RENEW.  I APPEALED THE FINE AND AFTER PROVIDING THE CASE HISTORY, THE FINE WAS WAIVED.""
