ALTHOUGH THE FORMS EXPLICITLY STATED THAT NO FUNDS WOULD BE RELEASED WITHOUT THE CLIENT'S SIGNATURE, THE FIRM SENT A DISTRIBUTION CHECK TO THE CLIENT. I CALLED THE FIRM TO CLEAR UP THE MISUNDERSTANDING, AND THE CLIENT'S FUNDS WERE REINSTATED. ALTHOUGH THE CLIENT WAS SATISFIED WITH THE RESOLUTION AND EVEN WROTE A LETTER IN MY SUPPORT, VALIC TERMINATED ME. FINRA FOLLOWED UP WITH AN INVESTIGATION AND TOOK NO FORMAL ACTION AGAINST ME.""
