  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This event happened at a party. My girlfriend and I both intoxicated got into a purely verbal altercation. The type of argument that can be described as a yelling match. At one table, the kind with folding legs, covered with glasses/dishes from the party was accidently knocked over. The noise of both the yelling and the sound of a crashing table caused a third party, likely a concerned neighbor to call the police. The Police arrived at the scene with a report of a domestic dispute between a couple. Despite my girlfriend and witness statements confirming nothing physical had occurred between us I was still taken into custody. The police explained California has a mandatory arrest law that requires one individual be removed from the scene and taken into custody during a call involving a domestic dispute.""
