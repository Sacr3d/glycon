  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE ESSENCE OF THE COMPLAINT IS THAT A GROWTH STYLE OF INVESTING WAS NOT AN APPROPRIATE STRATEGY FOR [CUSTOMER] AND CONSEQUENTLY HE HELD US RESPONSIBLE FOR THE \""BEAR\"" MARKET LOSSES OF 2000 THROUGH 2002. [CUSTOMER] WAS A SOPHISTICATED INVESTOR WITH A 20+ YEAR HISTORY OF INVESTING.  HE WAS THE SENIOR VP OF TECHNOLOGY FOR INVESCO, THE MUTUAL FUND COMPANY.  HE WAS REFERRED TO ME BY CHARLES SCHWAB & CO., FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEEKING ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY, SEPARATE ACCOUNT MONEY MANAGERS.  I PLACED HIM IN A MULTIPLE MONEY MANAGER STRATEGY, WHICH APPROXIMATED THE RISK OF THE S&P 500.  OUR CLIENT SYSTEM OF DETERMINING SUITABILITY INCLUDES GATHERING ALL AVAILABLE DATA, ORGANIZING THAT DATA, IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING.  [CUSTOMER] COMPLETED AND SIGNED A RISK PROFILE IN WHICH HE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH A RISK TOLERANCE OF 8-9 ON A SCALE OF 1-10, 10 BEING THE HIGHEST.  [CUSTOMER] HAND WROTE ON THE RISK PROFILE THAT HE EXPECTED RETURNS OF 20%.  [CUSTOMER] WAS GIVEN THREE HIGH-LEVEL INDEX STUDIES OR COMPARISONS DURING THE COURSE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP TO EVALUATE HIS PORTFOLIO'S PERFORMANCE.  [CUSTOMER] RECEIVED MONTHLY STATEMENTS FROM CHARLES SCHWAB & CO., AND QUARTERLY REPORTS FROM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS, LTD.  OUR CORRESPONDENCE AND REVIEW SYSTEM INCLUDED SEVEN CLIENT REVIEWS AND OVER 80 CONTACTS IN 27 MONTHS WITH [CUSTOMER].  [CUSTOMER] FILED A MOTION IN DENVER DISTRICT COURT TO CONFIRM THE ARBITRATION AWARD AND WE FILED A MOTION OF VACATE THE AWARD.  THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED [CUSTOMER'S] MOTION TO CONFIRM THE AWARD AND ENTERED JUDGMENT ON OCTOBER 27, 2006.  THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGMENT WAS APPEALED, WHICH APPEAL WAS DENIED BY THE COLORADO COURT OF APPEALS ON JUNE 12, 2008.""
