  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT AT QUICK & REILLY (MY CURRENT EMPLOYER)  INFORMED ME THAT THE STATE OF MICHIGAN HAD REQUESTED MORE DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING AN OUTSTANDING LIEN THAT HAS BEEN FILED AGAINST ME.  IN ADDITION, MICHIGAN HAD DIRECTED THAT I PROVIDE A PERSONAL BALANCE SHEET REFLECTING MY TOTAL NET WORTH.     PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT WHILE I WAS AND STILL AM WILLING TO PROVIDE THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION REGARDING THE LIEN, I DO OBJECT TO PROVIDING THE BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION THAT DETAILS MY TOTAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  I CONSIDER THIS PART OF THEIR REQUEST TO BE OVERREACHING AND TOO MUCH OF AN INTRUSION INTO MY PERSONAL LIFE.  THE SPECIFIC REASON AS TO WHY I HAD NOT RESPONDED TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST FOR INFORMATION WAS THAT AT THAT TIME AND TO THE PRESENT I DID NOT AND STILL DO NOT HAVE ANY CUSTOMERS WHOSE ADDRESS WAS/IS IN MICHIGAN.   UNFORTUNATELY I FAILED TO INFORM MY COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT OF MY DECISION NOT TO RESPOND AND THIS WAS AN ERROR ON MY PART. IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN INTENTIONAL ATTEMPT TO VIOLATE THE SECURITIES REGULATIONS OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN AND I APOLOGIZE FOR ANY PROBLEMS THAT HAVE OCCURRED AS A CONSEQUENCE.""
