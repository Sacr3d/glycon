  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS CUSTOMER WAS REFERRED TO ME BY ONE OF OUR FINANCIAL REPRESENTATIVES OF MY FIRM TO HELP CONSOLIDATE A NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PLAN ASSETS INTO ONE PLAN SO SHE WOULD HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH INVESTMENT OPTIONS.  SHE WORKED AS A CONSULTANT FOR A PROPERTY AND CASUALTY AGENCY AND THIS ALLOWED US TO CREATE A 401K PROFIT SHARING PLAN.  UPON EXECUTION OF THE PLAN DOCUMENTS, THIS CUSTOMER CONSOLIDATED HER ASSETS INTO A PARK AVENUE SECURITIES BROKERAGE ACCOUNT UNDER THE NAME OF HER 401K PROFIT SHARING PLAN WITH THIS CUSTOMER HAVING FULL CONTROL OVER THE ACCOUNT AND ASSETS AS THE TRUSTEE.  THIS CUSTOMER THEN HAD PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS WITH HER HUSBAND INVOLVING LENDING HIM MONEY.  I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSIONS.  I INFORMED THIS CUSTOMER THAT THE MAXIMUM LOAN SHE COULD TAKE WAS $50,000 TO BE PAID BACK IN 5 YEARS.  I SAID AND FOLLOWED UP WITH A MEMORANDUM THAT HER ATTORNEY NEEDED TO BE INVOLVED.  THIS CUSTOMER DECIDED ON HER OWN ACCORD TO LEND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE 401K PROFIT SHARING PLAN ASSETS TO HER HUSBAND, HIS PARTNERS AND HIS FIRM.  I WAS NOT ASKED TO BE INVOLVED OR CONSULTED AS TO WHETHER IT WAS A VALID TRANSACTION, NOR REQUESTED TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE TERMS OF ANY AGREEMENT.  THIS CUSTOMER AND HER HUSBAND WERE DIVORCED 2 YEARS LATER.  AFTER THE LOAN WAS COMPLETED, THIS CUSTOMER'S EX-HUSBAND THEN DECIDED NOT TO PAY BACK THE LOAN.  I WAS NOT INVOLVED WITH ANY ACTIONS IN CREATING THIS LOAN, NOR A CAUSE FOR DEFAULT. I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY COMPENSATION RELATING TO SETTING UP THE 401K PROFIT SHARING PLAN OR RECEIVE ANY COMPENSATION FROM ANY PARTY RESULTING IN THE LOAN.  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS INVOLVED WITH ANY CIVIL ACTION, SINCE THIS LOAN WAS SET UP BETWEEN TWO PARTIES THAT I HAD NO INPUT EXCEPT TO SET UP A 401K PROFIT SHARING.  THIS CASE WAS SETTLED BY MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND MY INSURANCE COMPANY INSISTED IT WANTED TO CURTAIL THE FUTURE COSTS OF LEGAL FEES AND TRIAL COSTS.  I WAS NOT GIVEN THE OPTION TO FIGHT THIS IN COURT AND THUS THIS ISSUE IS NOW BEHIND ME.""
