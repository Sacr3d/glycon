  ""Broker Comment"" : ""RESPONSE FROM REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAM GOTSES:       IN FEBRUARY, 2011, A CONFERENCE CALL WAS INITIATED BY MERRILL LYNCH COMPLIANCE, MANAGEMENT, THE CLIENT, THE CLIENT'S DAUGHTER, A LICENSED ADVISOR/ASSISTANT AND REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAM GOTSES.  DURING THIS CALL, THE CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY HAD OVER A MILLION DOLLAR GAIN IN THE ACCOUNT AND WERE CONCERNED THAT IF THE STOCK MARKET FELL, THEY WOULD LOSE MONEY.  COMPLIANCE, MANAGEMENT AND REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAM GOTSES CONFIRMED THAT THERE WERE GAINS AND ASKED THE CLIENT AND HER DAUGHTER IF THEY WANTED TO LOCK IN THE GAINS OR REMAIN IN THE STOCK MARKET. THE CLIENT CONFIRMED THAT SHE WOULD BE UPSET IF SHE LOST THESE GAINS CREATED BY REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAM GOTSES AND DID NOT CARE IF SHE MADE MORE MONIES; THEREFORE, THE CLIENT GAVE LEGAL DIRECTIVES TO SELL. THE SELL ORDERS WERE READ BACK BY REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAM GOTSES AND BEFORE THE SELL ORDERS WERE TAKEN, THE CLIENT AND HER DAUGHTER ACKNOWLEDGED THE CONFIRMS FROM MANAGEMENT, COMPLIANCE AND REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAM GOTSES. THE SELL ORDERS WERE MADE AND CONFIRMED ON THE SAME CALL, BOTH THE DAUGHTER AND THE CLIENT WERE EXTREMELY RELIEVED AND PLEASED.  WHEN ANOTHER DAUGHTER, WHO WAS NOT PRESENT FOR ANY CONVERSATIONS, FOUND OUT THERE WERE SELL ORDERS ON HER MOTHER'S ACCOUNT SHE WROTE A SLANDEROUS, LIBELOUS AND UNSUBSTANTIATED COMPLAINT LETTER ALLEGING THE TRADES WERE MADE WITHOUT HER MOTHER'S CONSENT, STEMMING FROM AN ASSUMPTION THAT IF THESE POSITIONS WERE HELD UNTIL THE DEATH OF THE CLIENT, THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AN ADJUSTED COST BASIS BENEFITTING THIS DAUGHTER. THIS LETTER ASKED THAT THE TRADES BE REINSTATED SO THAT FUTURE ADJUSTED COST BASIS CALCULATIONS COULD BE MADE. MERRILL LYNCH IMMEDIATELY DENIED THIS LETTER AS THERE WAS NO MONETARY LOSS, THERE WERE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF GAINS AND MOREOVER, THERE WERE NO DAMAGES. REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAM GOTSES ALSO HELPED THE ATTORNEYS AND CPA SAVE THE CLIENT $26 MILLION IN TAXES DUE TO HIS INVESTMENT STRATEGIES.       IT IS UNCLEAR WHY THE COMPLAINT WAS REPORTED AS NO AMOUNT OF COMPENSATORY DAMAGES WERE ALLEGED.       AFTER THE LETTER, THE [CUSTOMER] FAMILY EXPRESSED A CONTINUED DESIRE TO RETAIN REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAM GOTSES AS THEIR FINANCIAL ADVISOR AND ASKED HIM TO INVEST ANOTHER $2 MILLION.""
