ALL DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE ANNUITY IN QUESTION WERE AT THE SPECIFIC WRITTEN REQUEST OF [CUSTOMER].  THIS IS ALL DOCUMENTED. FURTHERMORE, THE INVESTMENTS WITHIN THE ANNUITY WERE COMPLETELY SUITABLE GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE ANNUITY ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY A SMALL PORTION [CUSTOMER'S] ASSETS. I HAVE COOPERSTED FULLY WITH THE INVESTIGATION INTO THESE MATTERS CONDUCTED BY UBS AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS MATTER RESOLVED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I WAS GIVEN THE INDICATION BY OUTSIDE COUNSEL TO UBS THAT THIS MATTER WOULD BE RESOLVED POSITIVELY VERY SOON.""
