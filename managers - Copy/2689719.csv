  ""Broker Comment"" : ""AFTER MOVING TO SOUTH FLORDIA WITH MY WIFE AND CHILDREN IN JUNE OF 2010, WE ATTEMPTED ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT OCCASIONS TO SELL OUR HOME WHICH WE HAD PURCHASED IN 2006 FOR $560,000.  WITH THE VALUE OF OUR HOME DECLINING, WE ACCEPTED A SHORT SALE OFFER FOR $520,000 IN OCTOBER OF 2011. THIS WAS THE CURRENT FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE HOME.  OUR ATTORNEY FORWARDED THE PAPERWORK TO THE BANK WHO DID NOT REVIEW THE OFFER UNTIL FEBURARY OF 2012.  IN MARCH OF 2012, THE BANK MADE A COUNTER OFFER TO OUR PURCHASER FOR $620,000.  BASED ON THE DECLINE IN REALESTATE NOT ONLY IN OUR AREA, BUT ALSO NATIONALLY, OUR BUYER PULLED OUT OF THE DEAL AND WE WERE UNBLE TO FIND ANOTHER PURCHASER.  THE HOME EVENTUALLY FELL INTO FORECLOSURE.  WE WERE ADVISED BY OUR ATTORNEY TO FILE BANKRUPTCY TO PROTECT OUR OTHER ASSETS AGAINST ANY FURTHER ACTION BY THE BANK.""
