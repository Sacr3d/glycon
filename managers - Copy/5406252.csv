  ""Firm Name"" : ""Stephens Inc."",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Third party alleged employee violated research rules related to solicitation of investment banking business."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I answered this question yes because my prior employer, Stephens, answered yes to the Termination Disclosure question.    Stephens did so after a company falsely alleged to it that I was violating research rules related to solicitation of investment banking business, in retaliation for my refusal to change my research estimates at the company's demand.  Unfortunately, Stephens made no meaningful effort to understand the actual facts before bowing to the company's demands.""
