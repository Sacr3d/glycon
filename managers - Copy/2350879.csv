IN FACT, I MADE A POINT TO NOTE THIS INVESTMENT HAD ALREADY DECLINED WHEN I MENTIONED IT AS AN INVESTMENT OPTION.  AT THE TIME OF THE SECOND CALL, THE BASIS OF THIS COMPLAINT, THE FUND HAD ALREADY MEANINGFULLY DROPPED BELOW PURCHASE PRICE.  THIS IS FURTHER PROOF HE KNEW AT THE TIME THAT HIS INVESTMENT'S RETURNS COULD NOT BE GUARANTEED.  CLIENT WAS FULLY AWARE THAT FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS CAN GO DOWN FROM NOT ONLY HIS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE OWNING THEM BUT ALSO OUR NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST 10 PLUS YEARS.  **ARBITRATION FILED 7/10/2009""
