  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Mancusi consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he exercised discretion in effecting 45 transactions in a customer's accounts without prior written authorization from the customer to exercise discretion in these accounts and without the accounts having been approved for discretionary trading by his member firm. The findings stated that the discretionary trades did not occur before the end of a business day on which time and price discretion had been given. Mancusi also executed three transactions in another customer's account without prior authorization. The customer was out of the country and could not be reached to approve the sale of a security owned in a non-discretionary account. Mancusi sold the security and used the proceeds to purchase two other securities in the customer's account to replace it. As a result, the customer incurred fees, commissions, and ultimately a loss in disposing of an unwanted purchase into a new position, totaling $2,966.97."",
