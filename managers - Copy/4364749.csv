  ""Allegations"" : ""FINRA RULE 2010, NASD RULE 2110: RAIRIGH SUBMITTED FALSE LIFE INSURANCE APPLICATIONS TO AN INSURANCE CARRIER IN ORDER TO GENERATE COMMISSIONS AND TO INFLATE HIS PRODUCTION NUMBERS. THE LIFE INSURANCE APPLICATIONS WERE FALSE, IN THAT THE PROPOSED INSUREDS HAD NEVER AGREED TO APPLY FOR THE POLICIES; IN FACT, THE APPLICATIONS WERE SUBMITTED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT OF THE INSUREDS. RAIRIGH COMPLETED THE LIFE INSURANCE APPLICATIONS, FALSIFIED THE CUSTOMERS' SIGNATURES, LISTED HIS BUSINESS ADDRESS AS THE ADDRESS TO SEND THE NEXT QUARTERLY PREMIUM NOTICE, AND PAID THE INITIAL PREMIUM. AFTER THE LIFE INSURANCE POLICY WAS ISSUED, RAIRIGH WOULD TAKE THE POLICY TO THE CUSTOMER AND SEEK TO CONVINCE THE CUSTOMER TO KEEP THE POLICY BY EXPLAINING THAT THE CUSTOMERS MERELY HAD TO CONTINUE TO PAY THE QUARTERLY PREMIUMS IN ORDER TO KEEP THE POLICY."",
