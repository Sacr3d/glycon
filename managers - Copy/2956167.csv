  ""Allegations"" : ""FINRA RULES 2010, 8210, NASD RULES 2110, 3040: CHRISTENSEN SOLD APPROXIMATELY $650,000 IN A COMPANY'S PROMISSORY NOTES TO SIX CUSTOMERS. BASED UPON EXPECTED INTEREST PAYMENTS FROM THE PROMISSORY NOTES, FOUR OF THE CUSTOMERS ALSO PURCHASED LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES FROM CHRISTENSEN AND ANOTHER REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE EMPLOYED BY THE MEMBER FIRM. THESE CUSTOMERS EXPECTED TO USE THE PROMISSORY NOTE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO PAY FOR THE LIFE INSURANCE PREMIUMS. CHRISTENSEN FAILED TO PROVIDE THE FIRM WITH WRITTEN NOTICE OF THE PROMISSORY NOTE TRANSACTIONS AND THE FIRM DID NOT GIVE CHRISTENSEN APPROVAL TO ENGAGE IN THESE TRANSACTIONS. CHRISTENSEN RECEIVED DIRECT COMMISSIONS FROM THE COMPANY RELATED TO THE SALE OF THE PROMISSORY NOTES TO CUSTOMERS. CHRISTENSEN ALSO RECEIVED COMMISSIONS FROM THE SALE OF LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS TO THE CUSTOMERS WHO INTENDED TO FUND THOSE POLICIES WITH THE INTEREST PAYMENTS FROM THE PROMISSORY NOTES. THE COMPANY DEFAULTED ON ITS OBLIGATIONS AND THE CUSTOMERS LOST THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. THE CUSTOMERS WHO ALSO PURCHASED LIFE INSURANCE BASED UPON THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE INTEREST PAYMENTS FROM THEIR INVESTMENT RELINQUISHED THEIR POLICIES AND WERE COMPENSATED BY THE FIRM FOR THE PREMIUMS PAID. HOWEVER, THE CUSTOMERS DID NOT RECEIVE ANY REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE INVESTMENTS IN THE COMPANY. CHRISTENSEN COMPLETED A FIRM ANNUAL COMPLIANCE QUESTIONNAIRE, IN WHICH HE FALSELY STATED THAT: (1) HE HAD NOT BEEN ENGAGED IN ANY CAPITAL RAISING ACTIVITIES FOR ANY PERSON OR ENTITY; (2) HE HAD NOT RECEIVED FEES FOR RECOMMENDING OR DIRECTING A CLIENT TO OTHER FINANCIAL PROFESSIONALS; (3) HE HAD NOT BEEN PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS THAT WEREN'T APPROVED BY THE FIRM, INCLUDING PROMISSORY NOTES; AND (4) HE HAD NOT ASSISTED A CLIENT WITH AN APPLICATION FOR INVESTMENTS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE FIRM OR CONTRACTED OR OTHERWISE ACTED AS AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN A CLIENT AND A SPONSOR OF SUCH INVESTMENTS WITHOUT THE FIRM'S PRIOR APPROVAL. IN ADDITION, CHRISTENSEN FAILED TO RESPOND TO FINRA REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND TESTIMONY."",
