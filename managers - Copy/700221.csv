Accordingly, Respondent's request for a hearing was dismissed, and FINRA's September 17, 2015, Notice of Suspension constitutes FINRA's final action in this proceeding. As set forth in the Notice of Suspension, and with the issuance of the Order, Respondent was immediately suspended from associating with any member firm in any capacity, pursuant to Rule 9552(e), and he is therefore barred from associating with any member firm in any capacity, effective December 21, 2015, pursuant to Rule 9552(h).
