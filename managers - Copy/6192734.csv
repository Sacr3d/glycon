  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP (ARREST MADE OF MY SPOUSE AT THE TIME) AND WAS NOT RECEIVING ANY SUPPORT FROM MY HUSBAND, WAS ON A LIMITED INCOME AND WAS RAISING AN INFANT.  AS A RESULT, IN AN UNFORTUNATE TIME IN MY LIFE, I HAD CHECKS RETURNED FOR INSUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR DAYCARE, BABYSITTING AND GROCERIES.  BECAUSE I HAD LEFT THE RESIDENCE I WAS AT WITH MY SPOUSE, THE CHECK DIVERSION PROGRAM COULD NOT CONTACT ME FOR RESOLUTION AND COLLECTION ON THE CHECKS. WHEN THEY CALLED MY SPOUSE AT OUR RESIDENCE, HE INFORMED THEM I WAS NO LONGER LIVING AT THAT ADDRESS AND HE DID NOT PROVIDE THEM WITH A FORWARDING ADDRESS OR PHONE NUMBER, AS A RESULT THE CHECK DIVERSION PROGRAM FILED THE CHECKS WITH THE COURTHOUSE BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT CONTACT ME. THIS CHARGE WAS A MISDEAMEANOR AND WITHHELD FROM JUDICATION.  I PAID ALL FINES AND RESTITUTION FOR THE RETURNED CHECKS.""
