  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS ARRESTED ON MARCH 2, 1991 AT A LOCAL WAL-MART OR K-MART IN YUBA CITY, CA WHEN I WAS 16 YEARS OF AGE.  I WAS ARRESTED FOR STEALING A $.50 CHOCOLATE CANDY BAR.  I BELIEVE THE COP ARRESTED ME TO TEACH ME A LESSON SINCE I WAS A JUVENILE.  NO CHARGES OR SENTENCES WERE EVER MADE.  IN FACT, I HAVE CALLED THE YUBA CITY POLICE DEPTARTMENT, AND THEY HAVE NO RECORD OF MY ARREST AND SAID MY FILE WAS SENT TO SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE I WAS A RESIDENT OF SACRAMENTO AT THE TIME OF MY ARREST.  I HAVE CALLED THE SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY RECORD OF MY ARREST.  I HAVE CALLED THE SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY RECORD OF MY ARREST.  IN FACT, THEY WROTE ME A LETTER STATING THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY ARREST RECORD IN THEIR SYSTEM.""
