  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Wimberly consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he engaged in an outside business activity without providing prior written noticed to his member firm. The findings stated that Wimberly and a friend created a limited liability company (LLC) to invest in a technology company. Wimberly served as an officer and director of the LLC and contributed $50,000 to it. The findings also stated that Wimberly participated in private securities transactions through the LLC without providing prior written notice to the firm when the LLC purchased a convertible promissory note from the technology company. Later, Wimberly contributed an additional $20,000 to the LLC and thereafter purchased additional shares of the technology company on behalf of the LLC. In addition, Wimberly signed and submitted to the firm annual compliance questionnaires in which he failed to disclose the LLC and the transactions."",
