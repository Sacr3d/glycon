  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Bruckner consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he mismarked 20 order tickets as unsolicited when, in fact, he had solicited the underlying trades to his customers. The findings stated that the policy of Buckner's member firm required him to obtain the firm's written authorization prior to soliciting the securities that he recommended to the customers, because the securities were not covered by the firm's research division. Bruckner failed to obtain such authorization prior to soliciting the trades. The findings also stated that Bruckner caused the firm's books and records to be inaccurate by marking the order tickets as unsolicited."",
