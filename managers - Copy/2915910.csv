  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON 10-18-91 I USED A CREDIT CARD THAT WAS STOLEN. I DID NOT STEAL IT NOR WAS I PRESENT WHEN IT WAS STOLEN. I DID USE IT TO PUT GAS IN MY CAR. A MONTH LATER THE INDIVIDUAL WHO STOLE THE CREDIT CARDS WAS ARRESTED FOR MAKING EXCESSIVE PURCHASES ON THE CREDIT CARDS. FOLLOWING HIS ARREST, I WENT TO THE POLICE STATION AND INFORMED THEM THAT I HAD ALSO MADE A PURCHASE (THE GAS) THE NIGHT THE CARDS WERE STOLEN. I WAS CHARGED WITH PETTY THEFT AND ADJUDICATION WAS WITHHELD AFTER PLEADING NO CONTEST.""
