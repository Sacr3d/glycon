  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE COMPLAINT. I MET WITH BOTH CLIENTS WITH A PNC EMPLOYEE. WE MET MORE THAN ONCE AND DETERMINED THAT SOME PREFFERED'S AND OTHER FIXED PRODUCTS WERE A GOOD FIT FOR THE CLIENT. WE FULLY EXPLAINED THAT THE INVESTMENTS WERE NOT FDIC PRODUCTS AND THERE IS RISK. THE CLIENTS HAVE A HIGH NET WORTH AND YEARS OF INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR HIGHER RETURNS AND INCOME INVESTMENTS. THE PREFFERED'S FIT THAT NEED. THE CLIENT HAS SERVERAL OTHER PREFFERED'S AND DID NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THEY DID NOT DIP LIKE RGM (GENERAL MOTORS). THE CLIENT KNEW WHAT THE RISK WAS AND SIGNED ALL DISCLOSURES. SHE KNEW THESE INVESTMENTS MOVE UP AND DOWN AND ONLY COMPLAINED WHEN RGM WENT DOWN. JUST A FOOTNOTE I ENDED MY EMPLOYMENT WITH PNC INVESTMENTS IN JUNE 10TH OF 2005, MOST OF THE DECLINE IN RGM OCCURED IN SEPT, OF THAT YEAR).""
