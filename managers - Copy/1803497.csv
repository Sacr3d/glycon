  ""Allegations"" : ""ON 11/24/1998 [CUSTOMER] CALLED EPPING AND PLACED UNSOLICITED TRADES FOR 150 SHARES OF AOL AND 150 OF CPQ. ORDERS WERE ENTERED BY EPPING AND SUBSEQUENTLY CANCELLED ON 12/15/98 WHEN PAYMENT WAS NOT RECEIVED. THE CLIENT WAS AN ACTIVE TRADER AND ALLEGES THAT IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR EPPING TO CALL HER WHEN THE ACCOUNT DID NOT CARRY SUFFICIENT CASH BALANCES. PER [CUSTOMER], EPPING NEVER MADE ANY REQUEST OF THE CLIENT TO DEPOSIT ADDITIONAL CASH IN HER ACCOUNT. AFTER REPEATED INQUIRIES BY THE CLIENT AND ASSURANCES FROM EPPING THAT THE PROBLEM WAS BEING TAKEN OF, EPPING BOUGHT 100 SHARRES OF CPQ IN MARCH 99' FROM AVAILABLE CASH IN THE ACCOUNT, BUT NEVER ENTERED AN ORDER TO PURCHASE  THE AOL SHARES. ZIEGLER INVESTIGATED THE MATTER FOLLOWING EPPING'S RERIGNATION AND DELIVERED TO [CUSTOMER] THE 150 AOL SHARES AND THE 50 ADDITIONAL CPQ SHARES AT THE 11/24/98 PRICE, WITH ZIEGLER SUFFERING A LOSS ON THE BY IN OF $18,387. EPPING HAS NOT REIMBURSED ZIEGLER FOR THAT PAYMENT, DESPITE A DEMAND BY ZEIGLER."",

I BELEIVE A CHECK DID ARRIVE AND IT WAS DEPOSITED INTO [CUSTOMER'S] CHILDREN'S CUSTODIAL ACCOUNTS. I WAS TOLD REPEATEDLY THAT ZEIGLER'S BACK OFFICE AND PURSHING WOULD CLEAR UP THE PROBLEM. I MADE SEVERAL FOLLOW-UP CALLS AND WAS TOLD THIS WOULD BE RESOLVED. I KEPT [CUSTOMER] INFORMED AS TO MY ATTEMPTS TO GE THIS ISSUE RESOLVED.""
