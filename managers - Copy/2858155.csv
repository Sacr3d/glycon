  ""Firm Name"" : ""LPL Financial LLC"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Registered Representative's use of a broker's broker resulted in disadvantageous pricing for customers."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I categorically deny allegations that I undertook any actions which were disadvantageous to clients. In the context of the limited number of trades subject of these allegations, the stated reason for discharge does not represent a violation of investment related statutes, regulations, or industry standards of conduct. The principles and obligations of best execution control when determining the best market for the execution of fixed income securities, not internal execution or price alone. I endeavored to provide best execution for each of the subject trades and was provided no evidence that a better open market price was available for the subject trades at the time of execution, or that my former employer could have provided price improvement on the same through internal execution. I received no compensation for the subject trades, or for the use of a broker's broker. Additionally, I have never been asked to provide price improvement to clients. Moreover, my clients have confirmed that my former employer has neither offered, nor provided price improvement on the subject trades supposedly forming the basis of the allegations underlying my discharge. Given these facts, I believe my discharge was wrongful and does not support a 7F termination disclosure.""
