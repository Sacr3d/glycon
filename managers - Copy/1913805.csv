  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS EMPLOYED BY STRONG FUNDS FROM 11/88 TO 7/97. IN 8/90 I FILED FOR A PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY DUE TO DIVORCE. ALTHOUGH I DID NOT PERSONALLY FILE AN AMENDED U4 TO DISCLOSE THE BANKRUPTCY I NOTIFIED MY SUPERVISOR BILL WALLER. HE REFERRED ME TO STRONG'S LEAD LEGAL COUNSEL HELGE LEE. I WAS INFORMED THAT BECAUSE THIS WAS A PERSONAL NOT A BUSINESS BANKRUPTCY IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION. IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT I WAS GIVEN INCORRECT INFORMATION AND THE PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED ON FORM U4. WHEN I WENT TO DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION IN 1997 THE SATE OF TEXAS ENTERED A CONSENT ORDER AND AN ORDER OF REPRIMAND WAS ISSUED""
