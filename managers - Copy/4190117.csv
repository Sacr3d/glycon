  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CLIENT RECEIVED FULL AND FAIR DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MUTUAL FUND PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE. REGARDING THIS CUSTOMER COMPLAINT.  THESE WERE GOOD CLIENTS OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME.  VERY SIMPLY THE CLIENT COMPLAINED ABOUT THE ADDED COSTS OF BEING IN A 401K AND STATED THAT THEY DID NOT NEED IT ANYMORE.  I SUGGESTED MOVING THE FUNDS TO A SIMPLE ROLLOVER IRA.  I DID NOT SET UP THE 401K AND HADN'T HEARD THAT A 401K COULD EVEN BE INVESTED IN B SHARES BUT THAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE CASE AND THE CLIENT NEVER MADE ME AWARE NOR WAS IT LISTED IN THEIR DOCUMENTS TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION THAT THE EXISTING FUNDS WERE IN B SHARES.  THE CLIENTS AGREED THAT THIS MONEY WAS FOR THE LONG HAUL AND FELT THAT OF THE VARIOUS SHARE CLASSES THAT A SHARES MADE THE MOST SENSE, THE CLIENTS SIGNED A DOCUMENT THAT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY KNEW THE EXPENSES UP FRONT AND GOING FORWARD. I DID EXPLAIN TO THE CLIENTS THAT THERE WERE TWO WAYS TO DO THE ROLLOVER, DISTRIBUTION AND ROLLOVER WITHIN 60 DAYS AND TRUSTEE TO TRUSTEE TRANSFER, THEY ASKED ME HOW EACH WORKED AND AFTER EXPLAINING IT THEY CHOSE A DISTRIBUTION WITHIN 60 DAYS.  THE CLIENT FILLED OUT THE FORM WHICH CLEARLY STATED THAT THERE WOULD BE A 10% OR 20% WITHHOLDING WHICH THE CLIENTS WOULD NEED TO DEAL WITH, I TOLD THE CLIENTS THAT I WAS NOT A TAX ADVISOR AND THAT THEY SHOULD PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY AS THEY DID THE DISTRIBUTION AS IT PERTAINED TO THEIR TAX IMPLICATIONS.  TECHNICALLY I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO GIVE TAX ADVICE OF ANY KIND BUT I DID TELL THEM GENERALLY WHAT TO EXPECT AND HOW TO PROCEED.  THE CLIENTS CAME IN WITH A CHECK WHICH WE INVESTED AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL A YEAR LATER THAT THE CLIENT CAME TO ME TO SUGGEST THAT SHE NOW HAD A TAX PENALTY FOR THE UNROLLED AMOUNT AND THAT SOMEHOW IT WAS MY FAULT.  I DID ALL I COULD TO HELP THE CLIENT TO REVERSE THIS EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NOT MY FAULT THAT SHE DID NOT PAY CLOSER ATTENTION TO HER AFFAIRS.  I MADE CALLS TO TAX PLANNERS AND THE IRS TO SEE WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO. REGARDING THE [CUSTOEMR] COMPLAINT: I BELIEVED THAT BASED ON MY RECOLLECTION AT THE TIME OF FILING MY RESPONSE TO THE INITIAL COMPLIANT THAT THE ROLL-OVER THAT I HAD INITIATED FOR THEM WAS FROM A PREVIOUS EMPLOYER. HOWEVER, I DO STAND CORRECTED. UPON FURTHER REVIEW THE 401K THAT I DID ROLLOVER WAS A SOLO 401K THAT I HAD OPENED FOR THE CLIENTS. THAT SAID I STILL ATTEST THAT I WENT OVER THE VARIOUS OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE CLIENT WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE SOLO 401K WHICH AT THE TIME WERE A SHARES AND B SHARES. AFTER LAYING OUT THE VARIOUS OPTIONS THE CLIENTS CHOSE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH B SHARES BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE WERE WORKING WITH A SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNT, BECAUSE THE CLIENTS WISHED TO AVOID AN UPFRONT FEE AND BECAUSE THE CLIENTS HAD A LONGER TIME HORIZON FOR THESE INVESTMENTS.
