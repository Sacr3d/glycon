  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I was not aware that this judgment was outstanding.  Received a summons in 2013 regarding this debt. To prevent a judgment, I agreed to pay creditor in full with installments of $200 per month over 66 months & a final payment of 176.00. I called to ask why a judgment was filed. I was told by creditor to protect their interests.""
