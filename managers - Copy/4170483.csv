  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Shakeel Dewji paid an administrative fine of $4,000 which was reduced from the original amount of $6,500 and was granted registration in Florida as an associated person on July 9, 2015. The reduction in the fine was based on the fact that Shakeel Dewji relied on an independent compliance firm to inform all interested parties that he had moved his firm from the state of Massachusetts to the state of Florida. The independent compliance firm informed all interested parties of the firm's move to Florida, however, the independent compliance firm failed to inform the state of Florida that Shakeel Dewji had also moved to the State of Florida. The compliance firm did however inform all other states as well as the SEC about the move. This error on the part of the independent compliance firm  was the reason for the reduction in the fine from $6,500 to $4,000.""
