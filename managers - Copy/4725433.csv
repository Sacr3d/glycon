  ""Allegations"" : ""CLIENT ALLEGES SHE TRANSFERRED HER ASSETS INTO HER VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACTS BASED ON THE AGENT'S REPRESENTATION THAT THERE WOULD BE NO TAX CONSEQUENCES. CLIENT FURTHER ALLEGES THAT WHEN THE AGENT ASSISTED HER IN TAKING A DISTRIBUTION FROM HER ANNUITY CONTRACTS, HE DID NOT INFORM THE CLIENT THAT SHE COULD TAKE THE DISTRIBUTION EQUALLY FROM BOTH CONTRACTS SO THAT HER BENEFIT BASE IS NOT IMPACTED. CLIENT IS REQUESTING THE FIRM TO REPROCESS THE $12,000 WITHDRAWAL FROM HER TWO ANNUITY CONTRACTS IN EQUAL AMOUNTS AND TO RECLASSIFY THE TRANSFER OF HER ASSETS TO AXA AS A 2008 DISTRIBUTION INSTEAD OF 2007. DAMAGES ARE UNSPECIFIED."",

AS FOR MOVEMENT OF AFTER TAX VEHICLES THE CAPITAL GAINS NECESSITY WAS FULLY DISCUSSED. THE INTENT WAS TO CONSOLIDATE TO REDUCE FEES AND PROVIDE THE CLIENT WITH A PRODUCT PROVIDING FOR PROTECTION FROM THE MARKET VOLATILITY INSTEAD OF OTHER OPTIONS DISCUSSED. THE CLIENT WAS AWARE OF HOW DISTRIBUTIONS WOULD BE TREATED AND SELECTED THE DISTRIBUTION HERSELF THE ACCOUNTS WERE NOT DISCRETIONARY.
