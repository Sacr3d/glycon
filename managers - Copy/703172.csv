  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The claims filed on November 3, 2016 by [REDACTED] against SII, Mr. Madson and one additional party in FINRA Arbitration No. 16-03175 were settled on Wednesday, December 12, 2018 at a FINRA-sponsored mediation. The case was settled by Mr. Madson's former broker-dealer's insurance company for business purposes because of the expense and delay of the arbitration proceeding. Mr. Madson paid nothing to [REDACTED] as part of the settlement, and [REDACTED] specifically acknowledged that the case was being settled with no admission of liability or wrongdoing of any sort by Mr. Madson. To the contrary, he vigorously disputed and defended against the allegations made by [REDACTED] in the arbitration.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WORKED WITH THIS CLIENT FOR MANY YEARS.  THE CLIENT HAD EXPERIENCE WITH ALL OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT WERE SELECTED FOR THE PORTFOLIO.  THE PORTFOLIO WAS WELL DIVERSIFIED AND REGULARLY REVIEWED.  THIS ACTION WAS FILED AGAINST MY BROKER-DEALER, SII INVESTMENTS, INC.  I WAS NOT A NAMED PARTY TO THE SUIT NOR WAS I FOUND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INVESTMENT LOSS.  I WAS NOT FINED OR SANCTIONED FOR THE SITUATION.    PERSONALLY, I FEEL THE CLIENT WAS WELL AWARE OF ALL OF THE INVESTMENT RISKS AND UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING.  THE CLIENT STILL OWNS THE INVESTMENTS.  IN MY OPINION, THE CLIENT SHOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED ANY SETTLEMENT.  THE BROKER-DEALER SETTLEMENT WAS A DECISION RECOMMENDED BY THE ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING THE BROKER-DEALER TO AVOID A COSTLY LITIGATION.    REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS ARE EXCELLENT INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES FOR MANY CLIENTS' PORTFOLIOS.  AS INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES, REITS WILL CREATE DIVERSIFICATION AND BE NON-CORRELATED TO OTHER INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS STOCKS.  THUS, CREATING A MORE BALANCED PORTFOLIO FOR THE INVESTOR.""
