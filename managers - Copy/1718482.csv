THE CUSTOMERS MET WITH BULLIS TO COMPLETE THE APPLICATIONS FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS AND SIGN SEVERAL DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING ANNUITY APPLICATIONS, TRANSFER FORMS AND DISCLOSURE FORMS. SOME OF THE DOCUMENTS COMPLETED AND SIGNED THAT DAY WERE INCOMPLETE OR INACCURATE. SPECIFICALLY, A CUSTOMER'S ANNUITY APPLICATION WAS INCOMPLETE IN THAT IT FAILED TO INCLUDE THE ANNUITY TYPE, PREMIUM PAYMENT, OPTIONAL BENEFITS AND TRANSFER INFORMATION, AMONG OTHER THINGS. THE CUSTOMER'S VARIABLE ANNUITY DISCLOSURE FORM WAS INCOMPLETE IN THAT IT FAILED TO INCLUDE ALL OF THE INFORMATION ON THE SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON ABOUT THE EXISTING ANNUITIES THAT WERE BEING TRANSFERRED. THE OTHER CUSTOMER'S VARIABLE ANNUITY DISCLOSURE FORM WAS INCOMPLETE IN THAT IT FAILED TO INCLUDE ALL OF THE INFORMATION REQUIRED ON THE SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON ABOUT THE ANNUITIES BEING TRANSFERRED AND THE NEW ANNUITY, AND WAS INACCURATE IN THAT IT INCLUDED INCORRECT INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEW ANNUITY. BULLIS PROVIDED THE CUSTOMERS WITH DOCUMENTS PURPORTED TO CONTAIN AN OVERVIEW OF THE TRANSACTIONS AND THAT CONTAINED ANALYSES AND EXPLANATIONS FOR THE DIFFERENT TRANSFERS AND BENEFITS AND COSTS OF THE NEW ANNUITIES. THESE DOCUMENTS CONTAINED INCOMPLETE AND INACCURATE INFORMATION, WERE CONFUSING AND MISLEADING, AND DID NOT DISCLOSE THE NAME OF THE MEMBER FIRM. ONE OF THE CUSTOMERS EMAILED BULLIS AND MADE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS, INCLUDING THAT TRANSACTIONS INFORMATION PRESENTED THE CUSTOMER WAS CREATIVE ACCOUNTING, THAT BULLIS HAD CHURNED THE CUSTOMERS' ACCOUNTS, THAT CERTAIN ANNUITIES HAD NEVER BEEN DISCUSSED AS PART OF THE CONSOLIDATION, AND THAT THE TRANSACTIONS HAD RESULTED IN LOSSES TO THE CUSTOMERS OF $156,000. THE CUSTOMER CLOSED THE EMAIL ASKING BULLIS HOW THEY WOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR THESE LOSSES AND INSTRUCTING HIM NOT TO INITIATE OR PERFORM ANY NEW ACTION WITH THEIR FUNDS UNLESS THEY SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCT HIM TO DO SO. BULLIS FAILED TO REPORT THIS COMPLAINT TO HIS FIRM AND WILLFULLY FAILED TO UPDATE HIS FORM U4 WITHIN THIRTY-DAYS OF ITS RECEIPT."",
