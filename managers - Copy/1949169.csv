HILLE RECEIVED ENTIRE CONTRACT VALUE TO DATE OF SURRENDER WHICH INCLUDES ALL EARNINGS ($2849.00). I BELIEVE MR. HILLE MISUNDERSTOOD THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANNUITIZING (NO SURRENDER CHARGES) AND CASH SURRENDER. WHILE I DO NOT SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER THE DISCUSSIONS, I BELIEVE CHARGES WERE COVERED, ESPECIALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH ANNUITIZATION.  I DO NOT RECALL EVER DISCUSSING A MATURITY DATE OF 3 YEARS ( OR ANY OTHER MATURITY DATE).  PRUDENTIAL MADE NO FINDINGS ON WHETHER THE ALLEGATION HAS MERIT, AND I BELIEVE IT HAS NONE.  IF MATURITY OF 3 YEARS HAD BEEN DISCUSSED, I WOULD NOT HAVE OFFERED THE CONTRACT.""
