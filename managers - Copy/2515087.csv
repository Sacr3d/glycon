  ""Broker Comment"" : ""FINRA CORRESPONDENCE DATED 02/25/015 REFERENCING THIS CASE WAS PROVIDED BY THE REPRESENTATIVE INDICATING THE CASE HAD BEEN \""SETTLED OR RESOLVED\"".  The client contacted Mr. Pecoraro as a salaried employee of TIAA CREF. The client signed an account agreement stating himself as self-directed investor, otherwise known as a sophisticated investor. The refused professional ongoing management by TIAA-CREF and Mr. Pecoraro. All of which was documented in meeting notes. The client requested our bond inventory which Mr. Pecoraro provided. After independent review, without the assistance of Mr. Pecoraro, the client decided to purchase a AAA rated and AMBAC insured tax free bond. Mr. Pecoraro purchased said bond per the client's request in 2007. The client never contacted Mr. Pecoraro again. In 2013 Mr. Pecoraro was made aware that the client had filed a complaint alleging TIAA-CREF had failed to supervise. The bond value fell during and up to the 2008 financial crisis. Ultimately the bond defaulted and AMBAC, the insurer went bankrupt. The complaint was only filed after these events. TIAA CREF chose to settle for $14,999 under the $15k limit, rather than prolong the legal process and dispute in court.""
