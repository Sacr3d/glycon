  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE ARREST RESULTED FROM A SOBRIETY STOP.  I INSTRUCTED THE OFFICER THAT I WOULD ALLOW FOR BLOOD WORK, NOT A BREATHALIZER.  SUBSEQUENT TO A SOBRIETY FIELD TEST, WHAT I THOUGHT WAS EXCESSIVE FORCE WAS APPLIED AS AN ATTEMPT TO ARREST ME...AND I RESISTED.  ADDITIONAL OFFICERS ARRIVED, AND I WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.  THIS RESISTANCE WAS FILED AS INTENT TO HARM AN OFFICER, AND DAMAGE PROPERTY.  I HAD NO INTENTION OF DOING EITHER, AND VISITED THE STATION THE FOLLOWING DAY TO APPOLOGIZE.  MY CONVICTION WAS A MISDEMEANOR, 3 DEGREE ASSAULT.  I REMEMBER HAVING TO GO WITHOUT MY DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR 6 MONTHS, EXCEPT DRIVING TO WORK.  I DO NOT RECOLLECT HAVING TO PAY ANY FINES OR PENALTIES, EXCEPT THE PAYMENT TO MY ATTORNEY FOR SERVICES RENDERED.""
