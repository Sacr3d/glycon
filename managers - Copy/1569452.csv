WE BOUGHT STOCKS AND BONDS IN THE ACCOUNT AS CUSTOMER WAS ACTIVE IN THE MARKET IN OTHER ACCOUNTS. CUSTOMER PURCHASED A VARIABLE ANNUITY WITH ANOTHER REPRESENTATIVE IN THE AMOUNT OF $195,000 IN 1999, BUT DECIDED TO PULL IT AS THE OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ALLEGEDLY DID NOT COMPLY WITH CUSTOMER'S REQUEST TO SELL A STOCK WHEN HE REQUESTED AND IT WENT DOWN IN VALUE. WE PURCHASED VARIOUS ANNUITIES BOTH VARIABLE AND FIXED OVER THE NEXT 3 YEARS AS CUSTOMER WANTED TO PUT THAT MONEY BACK INTO THE MARKET. I FELT, AS WELL AS CUSTOMER DID AT THE TIME TO DOLLAR COST AVERAGE INTO THE MARKET WITH RATES AS HIGH AS 11.50% TO MINIMIZE RISK. WE DID INVEST BACK INTO THE MARKET TO THE EXTENT OF $105,000 OVER TIME, ALSO TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURE (STILL DOWN FROM THE $195,000 ORIGINALLY INVESTED). I FELT I COMPLIED WITH THE CUSTOMER'S REQUEST OF GOING INTO THE MARKET (ONLY 55% OF ORIGINAL), ACTUALLY MINIMIZING THEIR RISK AS I FELT AND STILL FEEL THE MARKET WILL REBOUND OVER TIME. I ADDED INCOME FUNDS AS WELL AS PREFERRED STOCK TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURE. I CONSTANTLY MET WITH CUSTOMERS AT THEIR RESIDENCE GOING OVER ALL CONCERNS AND LOOKING FOR THE LONG TERM HORIZON. BY LOOKING AT THE VARIABLE ANNUITIES RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES AS CUSTOMER WANTED, WE FELT HIS FAMILY WAS BETTER PROTECTED WITH A DEATH BENEFIT. THIS EVENT IS NO LONGER REPORTABLE.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""REP'S RESPONSE:  CUSTOMER AND I HAVE DONE BUSINESS FOR 12 YEARS. CUSTOMER'S INVESTMENTS HAD CONSISTED OF LONG TERM INVESTMENT STRATEGIES: TAX FREE ZERO MUNICIPAL BONDS, U.S. TREASURY ZERO COUPON BONDS AND INTEREST PAYING TAX-FREE BONDS. IN 2000, I DISCUSSED EQUITY OPPORTUNITIES IN THE TECH SECTOR WITH CUSTOMER AND RISKS INVOLVED. CUSTOMER REQUESTED TECH FUNDS.  CUSTOMER HAD PROCEEDS FROM FATHER'S LIFE POLICY, I RECOMMENDED A LADDERED BOND PORTFOLIO. CUSTOMER USED SAID PROCEEDS AND WENT TO ANOTHER BROKER DEALER, SOLOMAN SMITH BARNEY (SSB) AND INVESTED FUNDS IN A MANAGED FEE-BASED ACCOUNT. MARKET WAS DOWN, CUSTOMER WAS UNHAPPY AND ASKED THAT I TAKE THE ACCOUNT . SSB SUGGESTED CUSTOMER SELL ALL THOSE POSITIONS AND CUSTOMER DECLINED. I LOOKED AT POSITIONS AND SPOKE TO CUSTOMER ABOUT THE SECURITIES AND OFFERED A MUTUAL FUND AS AN ALTERNATIVE, WHICH HE DECLINED.  CUSTOMER DECIDED PORTFOLIO WAS DIVERSIFIED, WANTED TO KEEP IT INTACT AND HE BELIEVED WOULD RECOUP LOSSES LATER. I DID NOT PURCHASE ANY OF THE EQUITIES IN THIS ACCOUNT NOR DID I RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR THESE INVESTMENTS.     COMPLAINT DENIED 3/13/03.   THIS EVENT IS NO LONGER REPORTABLE. ""
