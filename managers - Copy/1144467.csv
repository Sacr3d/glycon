  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CLIENTS WERE PAID $35,000 IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR INTEREST IN 5 UNITS OF TAMPA FOODS L.P. & THE RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS AGAINST K.O.S.I. THE FIRM SOLD THE 5 UNITS FOR $12,000. THEREFORE, THE ACTUAL SETTLEMENT AMT WAS $23,000. THE ONLY NOTIFICATION I HAVE ON THIS MATTER IS COPY OF REVISED U-5 FROM KEMPER. TAMPA FOOD PARTNERSHIP WAS PURCHASED APPROX. 3 YRS AGO. CLIENT RECEIVED GUARANTED DIVIDENDS FOR MUCH OF THIS PERIOD; DISTRIBUTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE FOR SOME TIME DUE TO LACK OF EARNINGS; CLIENT & WIFE RECIEVED PROSPECTUS, CAME INTO MY OFFICE TO DISCUSS IT FURTHER AND MADE CHOICE WITH FULL KNOWLEGE OF RISKS INVOLVED. THIS IS FRIVOLOUS & VAGUE, BUT TO DATE KEMPER HAS NOT EVEN ASKED ME TO RESPOND TO CHARGES.""
