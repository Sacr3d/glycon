  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS A YOUNG, NINETEEN YEAR OLD KID EXPERIMENTING WITH ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA. THE JUDGE RECOGNIZED THIS, DISMISSED THE CHARGES AND GAVE ME A \""STAY OF ADJUDICATION\"" WHICH MEANS IT IS ALL SUPPOSED TO BE WIPED OFF MY RECORD. I'VE WENT INTO THE COURTHOUSE TO INQUIRE ABOUT WHY IT IS STILL ON MY RECORD AND THEY REPLIED THAT \""THESE THINGS ARE NEVER COMPLETELY WIPED OFF OF YOUR RECORD.\"" I AM NOW AN ADULT WHO HAS LEARNED FROM HIS MISTAKES AND USED THAT EDUCATION TO RAISE 2 WONDERFUL DAUGHTERS AND MENTOR MANY AREA YOUTH.""
