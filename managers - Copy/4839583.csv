  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MY FRIEND AND I SPLIT A SPOT ON AN 8 MEMBER HUNTING LEASE. HE WAS OUT OF POCKET AND ASKED ME TO SIGN FOR HIM. I SIGNED BOTH OUR NAMES AND FAXED FROM ONE OF MY BANK BRANCHES. I NOTICED ON THE FAX CONFIRM HOW SIMILAR THE NAMES LOOKED SINCE WE HAVE THE SAME FIRST NAME AND I SIGNED IT IN A HURRY. I HAPPENED TO BE TALKING TO ONE OF MY BANKERS AND SHOWED HIM THE SIGNATURES. I MENTIONED HOW DETAIL ORIENTED THE LAND OWNER IS, AND THAT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF SHE NOTICE AND MADE US DO IT OVER. I ASKED HIM ABOUT SIGNING MY FRIENDS NAME SO IT LOOKED DIFFERENT. I IMMEDIATELY SAID, NEVER MIND IT'S ALREADY FAXED AND NOT A BIG DEAL. BANK BRANCH MANAGER (THE BANKERS BOSS) OVERHEARD AND REPORTED IT TO HR. MY MANAGER CALLED ME AND TOLD ME IT WAS REPORTED TO HR AND GAVE ME THE OPTION TO RESIGN. I TOLD HIM I WANTED TO EXPLAIN MY SIDE TO HR FIRST BUT THEIR DECISION WAS ALREADY MADE. I WAS TERMINATED THE NEXT DAY.""
