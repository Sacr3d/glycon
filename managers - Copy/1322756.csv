  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I REFERRED QSI INC. TO A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE INSTALLATION OF A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN. THE PLAN WAS TO EXCLUDE HIGHLY COMPENSATED SALES PEOPLE. THE TPA INSTALLED A PLAN THAT DID NOT EXCLUDE THE SALES PEOPLE. THE PLAN WAS AUDITED IN 1999,IN PREPARATION FOR SALE OF THE COMPANY. THE ERROR WAS DISCOVERED. I IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT IN, AT MY EXPENSE, A SECOND TPA WHO CORRECTED THE PLAN. ALTHOUGH THE PLAN WAS CORRECTED, CONTRIBUTIONS HAD TO BE MADE FOR THE HIGHLY COMPENSATED SALES PEOPLE FOR THE YEARS 1996, 1997 AND 1998. THE ORIGINAL TPA HAD ALLOWED HIS E&O INSURANCE TO LAPSE, WENT THROUGH A DIVORCE AND HAD NO ASSETS. SINCE I HAD PROPER E&O INSURANCE, MY CLIENT, QSI,INC. SOUGHT RELIEF FROM THE LOSS THROUGH ME. ALTHOUGH A CIVIL COMPLAINT WAS FILED, IT WAS SETTLED WITHOUT LITIGATION.""
