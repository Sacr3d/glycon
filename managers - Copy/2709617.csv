  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS REVIEW OF PAYMENT WAS REQUESTED IN OCTOBER, 2013, FOUR YEARS AFTER THE CASE WAS ORIGINALLY HEARD AND, I MISTAKENLY THOUGHT, WAS DISMISSED.  AT THE TIME, I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE JUDGE REGARDING MY ABILITY TO PAY, AND THOUGHT HE HAD DISMISSED THE DEBT. THERE WAS NO FOLLOWUP DOCUMENTATION FROM THE COURT OR THE PLAINTIFF CONFIRMING THE JUDGEMENT OR ASKING FOR PAYMENT.  THE REQUEST FOR PAYMENT REVIEW IN OCTOBER 2013 CAME AFTER 4 YEARS OF NO COMMUNICATION, AND WAS A SURPRISE TO ME.  AFTER I SPOKE WITH THE COURT CLERK I WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING TO FIGHT THE JUDGEMENT, AND THAT THE JUDGE WOULD PROBABLY NOT EVEN OPEN THE OLD CASE BECAUSE TOO MUCH TIME HAD GONE BY. BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OF AN ATTORNEY, AND THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO RE-OPEN THE CASE AND HAVE IT TRIED, AND THEN KNOWING IT WOULD PROBABLY NOT CHANGE THE OUTCOME, I DECIDED TO PAY OFF THE DEBT AND PUT IT BEHIND ME.  I AM SCHEDULED TO START PAYMENTS IN MARCH 2014 UNTIL THE DEBT IS SATISFIED.""
