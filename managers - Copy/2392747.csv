PRIOR TO THE COMPLAINT, I HAD MET WITH THE CLIENTS ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS FOR LUNCH AND AT THEIR HOME SINCE LEAVING THE BANK TO SIGN THE APPLICATION. IN ADDITION, I ASSISTED THE CLIENT, BY MAKING A THREE WAY PHONE CALL, WITH A TRANSACTION WITH HARTFORD BECAUSE I WAS UNABLE TO CHANGE HER ADDRESS DUE TO THE FACT I WAS NO LONGER WITH THE BANK AND NOT HER REP OF RECORD AND REMINDED HER OF THAT. LASTLY, THE CLIENT HAD RECEIVED AT LEAST TWO STATEMENTS OBVIOUSLY INDICATING THAT HER ACCOUNT WAS NOT WITH THE BANK PRIOR TO LODGING THE COMPLAINT. IN HER COMPLAINT LETTER HER DATES OF WHEN CERTAIN THINGS TOOK PLACE ARE COMPLETELY OFF BASE STARTING WITH THE MEETING WITH ME ON SUNDAY IN SEPTEMBER WHEN THE BANK WAS OBVIOUSLY CLOSED. I STAND BY THE ASSERTATION THAT SHE WAS COACHED INTO WRITING THIS LETTER BY THE CURRENT REP FOR THE BANK. THEREFORE, HER ASSERTATION THAT SHE WAS UNAWARE THAT I WAS NOT WITH THE BANK IS COMPLETELY WITHOUT MERIT.""
