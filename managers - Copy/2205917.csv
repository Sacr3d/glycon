  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The client contacted me to ask, \""if he should reduce his income benefit because he just spoke with the insurance company and they stated, \""No, there is no need to.\""  I recommended that he change nothing until I spoke with the company and I was subsequently told the exact same answer.    The contract, however, stated something different and I failed to refer to the contract having taken the word of the insurer at face value.  This resulted in the error as well as the settlement.""
