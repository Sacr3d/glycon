  ""Broker Comment"" : "" I WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AT THE TIME THIS ACCURED. THIS WAS ALSO ALMOST SIXTEEN YEARS AGO. I JUST GOT AROUND THE WRONG GUYS AND AFTER THE DEATH OF MY FATHER I HAD VERY LITTLE PARENTAL SUPERVISION. THIS WAS NOT A VIOLENT ACT, ONLY A SHOT GLASS AND A POCKET KNIFE WERE STOLEN. ITS WAS JUST KIDS WHO WERE VERY MISGUIDED. THIS WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME I HAVE EVER BEEN IN TROUBLE.SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE GROWN UP , GOTTEN MARRIED, HAD CHILDREN AND GONE INTO THE MINISTRY.  INCORRECTLY ENTERED THE YEAR OF 1998 INSTEAD OF THE YEAR 1988.""
