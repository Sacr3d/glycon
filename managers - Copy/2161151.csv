  ""Broker Comment"" : ""RR asserts the allegation that he moved the client's money without permission is false. The investment company was sold and the new managing company assumed responsibility for the fund. The clients consented to this action in client documents. RR states that some of the client's positions were illiquid however they agreed to the allocations by signing appropriate documentation. RR asserts the clients later decided they wanted to liquidate the investments at which time they became dissatisfied.""
