  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Admin Release 34-84025 / September 4, 2018:   The Securities and Exchange Commission (\""Commission\"") deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\""Exchange Act\"") against Douglas J. Derryberry (\""Derryberry\"" or \""Respondent\"").   The Commission finds that on August 17, 2018, a final judgment was entered by consent against Derryberry, permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Rule G-17 of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Douglas J. Derryberry, et al., Civil Action Number 3:18-cv-01895, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.   The Commission's complaint alleged that, from at least 2011 to the present, Derryberry purchased new issue municipal bonds in primary offerings from underwriters, which he then immediately sold, or \""flipped\"" to broker-dealer customers for a profit. Derryberry functioned as an unregistered broker by taking orders for bonds from broker-dealers who were unable to obtain those bonds directly, filling those orders with bonds he obtained from underwriters in new offerings, and receiving transaction-based compensation. In many cases, Derryberry obtained the bonds by falsely representing himself to underwriters and/or municipal issuers as a retail investor or representative of retail investors, thereby creating the misleading impression that his orders were entitled to a higher priority."",
