  ""Broker Comment"" : ""REP'S COMMENT: THE CLIENT UNDERSTOOD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPTION 1 AND OPTION 2 INSIDE THE TRUE RETURN RIDER IN ALLSTATE VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT, AND THE CLIENT DECIDED ON OPTION 2 FOR THE SECOND POLICY SINCE THE CLIENT HAD OPTION 1 IN THE FIRST POLICY. I ASKED THE CLIENT TO ADD THIS PREMIUM TO THE FIRST CONTRACT WHICH HAS OPTION 1, BUT THE CLIENT SAID NO, THE CLIENT WANTED DIFFERENT CONTRACTS WITH A DIFFERENT TRUE RETURN OPTION.  WITH THE MARKET BEING DOWN SO MUCH IN THE LAST 18 MONTHS I FEEL THE CLIENT HAS HAD A CHANGE OF HEART. I DISCUSSED THESE TWO OPTIONS IN DETAIL WITH THE CLIENT WHEN THE CLIENT PURCHASED THE FIRST ALLSTATE VARIABLE ANNUITY POLICY IN 2004, AND A SECOND TIME IN 2005 WHEN THE CLIENT PURCHASED A SECOND POLICY.""
