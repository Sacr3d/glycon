  ""Broker Comment"" : ""These charges stemmed from an incident that occurred with my [redacted] 7 year old son.  In one of his violent outburst he charged at me hitting me with a toy light saber and began biting me.  I reprimanded him letting him know that he shouldn't bite people because it doesn't feel good, I demonstrated by mildly biting him which got his attention and he calmed down and we began to calmly play together.  A mark was present on his arm and was seen by his teacher at school and the teacher made a report to DHS which launched an investigation with the county sheriff's office. I was charged with 3rd degree assault.  Trial Date was set for Jan 10, 2017.  Prior to trial the District Attorney issued a subpoena for my son and announced intention to motion to delay trial to evaluate my son's fitness to testify.  To prevent my 7 year old from having the ordeal of a trial and evaluation,  I agreed to a lesser charge and which carries a sentence of 3 years probation and small fine with a mandatory parenting class.""
