  ""Regulator Statement"" : ""On February 12, 2016, FINRA's Office of Dispute Resolution notified Gimblet that, under FINRA Rule 9554, his registration would be suspended effective March 4, 2016, because he had not paid an arbitration award. After the hearing and a review of the record, the Hearing Officer found that Gimblet did not meet his burden of proving a bona fide inability to pay the award. Effective immediately, Gimblet is suspended from associating with any member firm in any capacity until he produces sufficient documentary evidence to FINRA showing: (1) the award has been paid in full; (2) Gimblet and the arbitration creditor have agreed to settle the matter; or (3) Gimblet has filed a petition in a United States Bankruptcy Court, or a United States Bankruptcy Court has discharged the debt representing the award. Gimblet is also ordered to pay FINRA costs of $1,759.53, which include an administrative fee of $750 and hearing transcript costs of $1,009.53. These costs are due and payable immediately upon the issuance of this Decision. Decision No. ARB160009.""
