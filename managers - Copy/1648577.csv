  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The client sent an email to the advisor, which prompted the advisor to call.  The client asked for the advisor's opinion on selling, to which the advisor replied \""I don't know how high the stock could go, but often the best time to sell is when the news first comes out.\"" Based on this, the client gave the order to sell the stock.  The advisor followed the direction. There was approximately 100% profit on the sale.""
