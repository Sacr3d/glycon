  ""Broker Comment"" : ""1.REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE OVERSTATED HIS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES UPON WHICH HIS COMPENSATION, IN PART, WAS BASED: AT NO TIME DID I OVERSTATE MY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, I DOCUMENT EVERY CONTACT THAT WAS MADE WITH EVERY FINANCIAL ADVISOR, THAT INCLUDED BUT WAS NOT LIMITED TO EMAIL, CELLPHONE CALLS, TEXT MESSAGES, FAXES ETC..., I BELIEVED IT WAS VITAL TO THE BUSINESS TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND IN DETAIL EVERY INTERACTION BETWEEN MYSELF AND THE FINANCIAL ADVISORS IN MY TERRITORY. I WAS HOUSED IN PLYMOUTH MN, WHILE MY TERRITORY WAS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, ALASKA, HAWAII, LAS VEGAS AND THE STATE OF WASHINGTON, WHICH MEANT THE TIME DIFFERENCES WERE UP TO 5 HOURS, THIS LEAD TO ADVISORS CALL AFTER NORMAL NONSTANDARD BUSINESS HOURS AND I WOULD ASSIST THEM WITH THEIR CASES TO PROVIDE EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE; 2.AND CONDUCTED FIRM BUSINESS ON A PERSONAL DEVICE IN A MANNER THAT VIOLATED FIRM POLICY.  WHEN I ACCEPTED THE ROLE AS LIFE INSURANCE INTERNAL WHOLESALER, THE FIRM WAS BUILDING OUT THE SALES DESK DUE TO ACQUIRING A COMPETITOR LIFE BUSINESS, AT THIS TIME THERE WERE NO SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO CAPTURE INBOUND CALLS, ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS WAS FOR EVERYONE ON THE DESK TO INCLUDE THEIR PERSONAL CELLPHONE ON THE FOOTER OF THEIR EMAILS, PER THE EXPECTATION OF MANGERS AND DIRECTOR, THIS WAS TO ENSURE THE ADVISORS WOULD HAVE MULTIPLE POINTS OF CONTACT WITH THEIR WHOLESALER. THE FIRM PUSHED OUT THE GOOD APPLICATION TO MY MOBILE DEVICES AS WELL AS THE LIFE INSURANCE QUOTING SYSTEM TO SUPPORT ONGOING FINANCIAL ADVISOR SUPPORT. IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED IN MEETINGS AND PRAISE WAS GIVEN FOR MY ACTIONS OF GOING BEYOND EXPECTED LEVELS TO ENSURE MY TERRITORY WAS ACHIEVING AT HIGH LEVELS. MY RESIGNATION WAS DUE TO ACCEPTING A ROLE WITH A COMPETING FIRM IN MY HOME STATE OF OHIO, AND I WAS UNAWARE OF THESE ALLEGATIONS UNTIL THE NEW BROKER-DEALER MADE ME AWARE OF THEM. FIRNA CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION AND BASED ON THE INFORMATION, IT WAS DETERMINED BY FINRA TO CLOSE.""
