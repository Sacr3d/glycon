  ""Broker Comment"" : ""[CUSTOMER] REQUESTED TAX-FREE INCOME DUE TO HIS HIGH TAX BRACKET. I GAVE HIM A FULL PRESENTATION, BROCHURE AND PROSPECTUS ON THE FRANKLIN CAL. TAX-FREE INCOME FUND(FKTFX), WHICH PROVIDES TAX-FREE INCOME FROM BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. [CUTOMER] INVESTED IN THIS VERY SAME FUND AND RECEIVED A CONFIRMATION STATEMENT INITIALLY AND MONTHLY STATEMENTS THEREAFTER CONFIRMING THIS SPECIFIC FUND POSITION. WE HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS CONFIRMING THIS AS WELL AND HE NEVER EXPRESSED ANY DISCONTENT  SO THERE WAS NO \""WRONG FUND\"" TRANSACTION. I ALSO PRESENTED FRANKLIN TEMPLETON'S NAV A-SHARE PURCHASE PLAN TO [CUSTOMER] WHICH ALLOWS AN INVESTOR WITH $1MM OR MORE TO GO INTO ANY FRANKLIN FUND ACCOUNT AT NO INITIAL COST, WHICH NORMALLY CAN GO UP TO AS HIGH AS 5.75% DEPENDING ON THE FUND CHOSEN.  FRANKLIN TEMPLETON ONLY ASKS THAT THE INVESTOR NOT TAKE MORE THAN THE DIVIDEND INCOME OUT PRIOR TO 18 MONTHS OR A 1% CDSC CHARGE IS INCURRED(THEN IT DROPS TO ZERO). [CUSTOMER] AGREED THAT WOULD WORK FINE. SUBSEQUENTLY MY COMPANY WAS SOLD TO WELLS FARGO BANK, WHO [CUSTOMER] SEVERELY DISLIKED FROM PREVIOUS DEALINGS. AS A RESULT, THROUGH NO FAULT OF MINE AS HE TOLD ME, HE TRANSFERRED HIS SHARES IN FKTFX TO ANOTHER BROKER/DEALER BACK EAST. HIS NEW FINANCIAL ADVISOR SOLD THESE SHARES PRIOR TO THE 18 MONTH HOLDING PERIOD AND A 1% CHARGE WAS INCURRED. I FOUND OUT LATER [CUSTOMER] WAS UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS FEE CHARGED BUT HIS NEW ADVISOR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS FEE BY NOT WAITING UNTIL 18 MONTHS HAD PASSED.  THUS, I FULFILLED MY FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES BY DELIVERING A HIGH QUALITY FINANCIAL PRODUCT WITHOUT ANY INITIAL CHARGES TO MEET [CUSTOMER'S] REQUESTED TAX-FREE NEEDS AND DID SO IN AN HONEST, FORTHRIGHT MANNER.\""         ALLEGED DAMAGES $150,000.00 SETTLED FOR $45,000.00""
