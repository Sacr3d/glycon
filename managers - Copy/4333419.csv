The findings stated that the individual chose not to inform most of his customers that he was going to be suspended; instead, he told his customers that Tramontano would be working with him. Over the next year, Tramontano was aware that the individual continued to engage in the securities industry while suspended by, among other things, communicating with customers, making securities recommendations to them, and placing trades on their behalf. Indeed, the individual, by using Tramontano as the broker of record, was able to continue to act as a registered representative, unabated, in nearly all respects during his year-long suspension."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""[customer] requested that annuity funds be distributed immediately due to a financial emergency.  [other firm employee] or Jill were not agents of record on the annuity. However,  in the interest of helping a client, they helped [customer] facilitate the withdrawal.  The [customers] were informed by the Annuity company that they violated a condition of a Rider on their policy.  They were also informed they had 30 days from the time of withdrawal to fix the error and restore the policy.  The [customers] did nothing.  The annuity company never informed [other firm employee] or Jill of the violation prior to the distribution.  Although they were already aware of the violation, The [customers] did not inform [other firm employee] or Jill of the violation until after the 30 day period expired. Although the [customers] feel that [other firm employee] or Jill should have known about the rider rule prior to the withdrawal, there was no way for them to know without information from the annuity company or the [customers] as they did not sell the [customers] the policy.  That information was never provided. The [customers] had invested in the policy in 2007.""
