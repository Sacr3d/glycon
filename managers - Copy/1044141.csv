  ""Broker Comment"" : ""DUE TO POOR BUSINESS CLIMATE AND SLOW CASH FLOW IN 2008-09 I GOT BEHIND IN TAX PAYMENTS. WHEN INITIALLY ADVISED OF LIEN (NFTL - SEPT 2011), I TALKED WITH IRS REP INDICATING MY INTENT TO REQUEST A HEARING TO APPEAL THE LIEN ACTION. AT THAT TIME I WAS TOLD ANY LIEN ACTION WOULD BE SUSPENDED OR HELD IN ABEYANCE PENDING THE HEARING OUTCOME. IT WAS ONLY DURING THE HEARING THAT I LEARNED ON 02/22/2012 THE LIEN WAS IN EFFECT. AT THIS TIME I PROMPTLY CONTACTED MY B/D (QUESTAR) AND WAS ADVISED TO SUBMIT THIS UPDATED U4. THE DELAY IN DOING SO IS DUE SOLELY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING ON MY PART.""
