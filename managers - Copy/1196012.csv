  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Admin Release 34-49790, June 2, 2004: In these proceedings instituted on November 26, 2003 pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Respondent Bruce J. Bates has submitted an Offer of Settlement which the Securities and Exchange Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission or in which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the Commission's findings herein, except as to the jurisdiction of the Commission over him and over the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Bates consents to the entry of this Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Against Bates. In late October 2000, Bates was hired by a firm to act as the branch office manager for an office of supervisory jurisdiction (the \""OSJ\"") maintained by it, and to conduct the day-to-day supervision of a registered representative (the \""Rep\""). Additionally, Bates shared the responsibilities of enforcing the special supervision of the Rep. In October 2000, the Colorado Division of Securities required that the Rep be subject to special supervision at the firm due to his disciplinary history and recent customer complaints. The firm adopted Colorado's special supervisory procedures for the Rep's activities at the firm in connection with all of his customers. Between December 2000 and April 2001, Bates failed reasonably to supervise the Rep with a view to preventing his violations of the federal securities laws by failing to follow the firm's procedures regarding heightened supervision of the Rep, and by failing to respond to red flags relating to the Rep's misconduct. Thereafter, between January and April 2001, Bates failed reasonably to supervise the Rep with a view to preventing his violations of the federal securities laws by failing to follow-up on customer complaints relating the Rep's misconduct. As a result of this conduct, Bates failed reasonably to supervise an individual with a view to preventing his violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, within the meaning of Section 15(b)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act."",
