  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CHARGES AROSE OUT OF AN INCIDENT WITH SEVERAL CLIENTS TRADING NAKED OPTIONS IN JUNE OF 1982, SPECIFICALLY, OPTIONS FOR CITIES SERVICE WHICH WERE DUE TO EXPIRE IN TWO DAYS. THERE WAS A TENDER OFFER FOR CITIES SERVICE, WHICH INCREASED THEIR $45 OPTIONS FORM 1/4 TO 9. MY CLIENTS WERE SHORT HUNDREDS OF OPTIONS AND LOST NEARLY $750,000.00 AMONG ALL OF THEM. THE SEC BELIEVED THEY WERE UNSUITABLE FOR SUCH TRADING; THAT ORDERS WERE ENTERED WITHOUT CUSTOMER'S KNOWLEDGE AND THAT THE RISKS WEREN'T FULLY EXPLAINED. I WOULD DISPUTE THESE ALLEGATIONS. I WAS ALSO CHARGED WITH SIGNING PAPERS TO TRANSFER FUNDS AND OBTAINING NEW ACCOUNT INFORMATION FROM A THIRD PARTY.   ""
