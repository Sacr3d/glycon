  ""Broker Comment"" : ""SOMETIME IN LATE 2001 AND THE END OF 2002 THE [CUSTOMERS] EXCHANGED AN IRA ANNUITY WITH THE HARTFORD FOR ANOTHER IRA ANNUITY. THIS WAS DONE TO PRESERVE THE BUILT UP DEATH BENEFIT WITHIN THE HARTFORD ACCOUNT. THE CLIENT FACED A SURRENDER CHARGE FROM HARTFORD, BUT ALSO RECEIVED A BONUS FOR GOING INTO THE NEW CONTRACT. THE OTHER ISSUE WAS THAT THE BENEFICIARIES ON THE NEW ACCOUNT DID NOT REFLECT THEIR CHILDREN AS CONTINGENT BENEFICIARIES. (THE PAPERWORK WITH THE NEW ANNUITY DID, BUT MERRILL'S SYSTEMS MADE ML THE CUSTODIAN, AND ON THAT PAPERWORK ONLY THE SPOUSE WAS LISTED AS A PRIMARY WITH NO CONTINGENT BENEFICIARIES).""
