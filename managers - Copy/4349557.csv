  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Rep Statement: The tax liability relates to a contested assessment of state taxes in NY state for 2008, 2009 and 2010 (state taxes were paid in California in each of these years as this has been my state of residency since December 2007).  My failure to have had actual notice appears to stem from a combination of the resignation of my attorney on the matter from the firm in March 2016 and the State of New York having only a prior address (valid through mid-2012) that they apparently did not update during the protracted negotiations on the claim - an agreed tax liability was reached in 2014.   I am in the process of setting up a payment plan to retire the tax liability in New York.""
