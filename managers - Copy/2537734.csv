THE CLIENT HAD AUTHORIZED THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE FEES IN WRITING; ONCE IN THE MASTER ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND ALSO IN A LETTER OF AUTHORIZATION FOR FEE LIQUIDATIONS.  THE CLIENT ALLEGES FORGERY WHICH I CATEGORICALLY DENY.  AS THE CLIENT HAD NOT DATED HER SIGNATURE ON THE LETTER OF AUTHORIZATION, I ADDED THE DATE.  THIS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE FORGERY.  THERE IS NO BASIS FOR EITHER FRAUD OR FORGERY AS THE CLIENT ALLEGES.  THE FEES WERE REIMBURSED TO THE CLIENT.   (PLEASE ARCHIVE)""
