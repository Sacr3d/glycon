CLIENT CONTENDS THAT THEIR ACCOUNT \""MISSED OUT\"" ON INVESTMENT GAINS FOR A PORTION OF THE ACCOUNT RESULTING FROM A SLOW AND CAUTIOUS STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION FROM CASH TO GROWTH INVESTMENTS. THE ACCOUNT ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN THE NINE MONTH TIME PERIOD IN WHICH WE, AS INVESTMENT MANAGERS, CAREFULLY INVESTED THE MONEY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATEMENT OF INVESTMENT POLICY, WHICH STATED \""PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL\"" AS ONE OF THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THE INVESTMENT ACCOUNT.

THIS CLAIM WAS SETTLED FOR \""NUISANCE\"" VALUE ONLY AND TO AVOID THE COST OF POTENTIAL LITIGATION.""
