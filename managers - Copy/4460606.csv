  ""Allegations"" : ""A CLIENT ASSIGNED TO MS. HOTALING SIGNED AN ACAT TRANSFER FORM IN ORDER TO TRANSFER A PORTION OF THE SECURITIES HELD IN AN ACCOUNT CUSTODIED WITH A THIRD PARTY BROKER TO A DISCRETIONARY ACCOUNT TO BE MANAGED BY MERCER'S AFFILIATE , THE AYCO COMPANY, UNDERSTANDING THAT A SECOND ACAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO TRANSFER THE REMAINING ASSETS IN THE THIRD PARTY ACCOUNT.  MS. HOTALING ATTEMPTED TO SUBMIT THE SECOND ACAT TRANSFER FORM USING THE SIGNATURE PAGE FROM THE INITIAL ACAT TRANSFER FORM.  THIS SECOND FORM WAS NOT ACCEPTED BY THE PROCESSING TEAM AT AYCO AND THE MATTER WAS ESCALATED.  THE CLIENT LATER EXECUTED NEW ACAT PAPERWORK AND THE TRANSFER OF ASSETS WAS COMPLETED."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MY CLIENT WHOM I COMPLETED THE PAPERWORK FOR WAS IN FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRANSACTION AS I HAD EXPLAINED IT THOROUGHLY TO HIM ON THE PHONE AND HE CONFIRMED THAT HE WANTED IT TO BE COMPLETED. DUE OF THE SIZE OF THE SECURITY HOLDINGS HE WANTED TO TRANSFER FOR THIS SINGLE REQUEST, TWO ACAT FORMS WERE NECESSARY TO TRANSFER IN KIND THE POSITIONS TO THE BROKERAGE ACCOUNT.  BEING UNCERTAIN OF THE PAPERWORK PROCESSING BECAUSE THIS TASK IS NORMALLY COMPLETED BY MY SUBORDINATE, I ASKED SOMEONE THAT I WORK WITH IF I COULD USE ONE SIGNATURE PAGE. I WAS TOLD THIS WAS FINE AND PROCEEDED. THERE WAS NO MALICIOUS INTENT, SIMPLY A HUMAN ERROR IN TRYING TO ASSIST MY CLIENT. I HAD NO PREVIOUS HISTORY OF PROBLEMS WITH COMPLIANCE IN MY 3.5 YEARS AT THE FIRM AND HAD RECEIVED NO WARNINGS FROM COMPLIANCE FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE DURING MY TENURE. UPON REVIEW, FINRA COMPLETED AN INQUIRY REGARDING THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND MADE A DETERMINATION TO CLOSE THE CASE WITH NO FURTHER ACTION.""
