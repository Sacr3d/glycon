  ""Allegations"" : ""FINRA RULE 2010, NASD RULE 3010 - JOEL BLUMENSCHEIN WAS DESIGNATED IN HIS MEMBER FIRM'S WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES AS A REGISTERED PRINCIPAL'S SUPERVISOR AND ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM, WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING HER ACTIVITY. THE PRINCIPAL, ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM SENT CORRESPONDENCE TO A CUSTOMER REGARDING A COMPLAINT  PROPOSING A SETTLEMENT ALTHOUGH SHE IS NOT AN ATTORNEY AND HAD NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE NEGOTIATING SETTLEMENTS. BLUMENSCHEIN DID NOT REVIEW HER LETTERS NOR DID HE REVIEW HER LETTER TO THE CUSTOMER INCORPORATING THE FORMAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. AFTER SHE WAS TOLD BY FINRA THAT THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT VIOLATED FINRA RULES, SHE NEGOTIATED A REVISED AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER WHICH ELIMINATED THE VIOLATIVE PROVISIONS; BLUMENSCHEIN ALLOWED HER TO DRAFT AND SIGN THE REVISED AGREEMENT WITHOUT REVIEWING THE DOCUMENT. BECAUSE OF PRIOR CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS AND THE CONCERNS OF A STATE REGULATOR, BLUMENSCHEIN'S FIRM PLACED A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE ON HEIGHTENED SUPERVISION WHEN HE JOINED THE FIRM; BLUMENSCHEIN WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND SUPERVISING THE REPRESENTATIVE'S ACTIVITY, INCLUDING A DAILY REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF ALL TRANSACTIONS AND NEW ACCOUNT DOCUMENTS. BLUMENSCHEIN DID NOT REVIEW TRANSACTIONS IN A CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT IN RELATION TO THE CUSTOMER'S FINANCIAL SITUATION OR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, MADE NO CUSTOMER-SPECIFIC SUITABILITY ANALYSIS, AND DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY TRANSACTION IN THE ACCOUNT AS CAUSE FOR HEIGHTENED SECURITY. BLUMENSCHEIN CONCEDED DURING A FINRA INVESTIGATION THAT CERTAIN PENNY STOCKS WERE NOT SUITABLE FOR THE CUSTOMER. WHILE THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE WAS EFFECTING TRADES IN THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT, BLUMENSCHEIN NEVER QUESTIONED OR DOCUMENTED ANY CONCERNS ABOUT ANY TRANSACTIONS IN THE ACCOUNT. THE MEMBER FIRM, ACTING THROUGH BLUMENSCHEIN, FAILED TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A SYSTEM TO REASONABLY SUPERVISE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS EFFECTED BY THE FIRM'S REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES. THE FIRM SUPERVISED TRANSACTIONS PRIMARILY BY MEANS OF BLUMENSCHEIN'S PERIODIC REVIEW OF A DAILY ORDER ACTIVITY REPORT SUPPLIED BY THE FIRM'S CLEARING FIRM. BLUMENSCHEIN USED THE REPORT TO IDENTIFY TRANSACTIONS HE CALLED OUTLIERS, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS IN STOCKS UNFAMILIAR TO HIM, USUALLY LARGE PURCHASES AND TRADES AWAY FROM THE MARKET, AND DEALT WITH THEM, IF AT ALL, IN AN AD HOC FASHION, WITHOUT DOCUMENTING EITHER THE IDENTIFIED TRANSACTIONS OR THE RESOLUTION, IF ANY, OF HIS CONCERNS. AFTER PROVIDING CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY, BLUMENSCHEIN TOLD FINRA THAT HE DID NOT ACCESS THE PENNY STOCK TRANSACTION REPORT THAT COULD ASSIST A SUITABILITY ANALYSIS OF PENNY STOCK TRANSACTIONS BECAUSE IT INCLUDED CUSTOMER'S NAMES, INVESTMENT PROFILES AND WHETHER TRADES WERE SOLICITED OR UNSOLICITED."",
