  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Weiss consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he failed to supervise reasonably the activities of a registered representative who recommended unsuitable mutual fund transactions to a customer. The findings stated that Weiss was responsible for supervising the member firm's registered representative. Among other things, Weiss was responsible for approving the representative's mutual fund recommendations. The customer opened an IRA account at the firm with the representative. The new account form listed the customer's investment objective as a preservation of capital and his investment time horizon as short-term (one-three) years. The new account form noted that the investment purpose for the account was to save for retirement. A month thereafter, the customer transferred mutual funds he held at another firm to his IRA account at the firm. All of the mutual funds were Class A shares from the same fund family. Three days later, based on the representative's recommendations, the customer sold the mutual funds and used the proceeds, totaling approximately $865,000, to purchase Class A shares of 14 different mutual funds from 12 different fund families (collectively, the new mutual funds). The recommendation to switch to the new mutual funds was unsuitable because the new mutual funds' investment objectives were not consistent with the customer's investment objective of capital preservation. Also, the Class A shares, which are generally appropriate for investors with long-term investment horizons, were not consistent with the customer's shorter investment horizon and by purchasing mutual funds from 12 different mutual fund families, the customer did not receive available breakpoint discounts. The findings also stated that while reviewing the representative's recommendations, Weiss failed to consider and ensure that the investment objectives of the new mutual funds were consistent with the customer's investment objective of preservation of capital. In addition, Weiss failed to consider and ensure that Class A shares were appropriate for the customer in light of his short-term investment horizon and that the customer received the benefit of available breakpoint discounts. Furthermore, Weiss failed to ensure that mutual fund switch letters sent by the representative to the customer included critical information, including the amount of the sales charges for the new mutual funds. Finally, Weiss lacked a reasonable understanding of mutual funds for properly discharging his supervisory responsibilities. For instance, Weiss did not know what breakpoint discounts were and did not know how front-end sales charges affected the suitability review of mutual fund transactions."",
