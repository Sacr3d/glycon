  ""Broker Comment"" : ""DEFENDANT WAS DIRECTED TO PAY CLAIMANT $15,614.04 WHICH WAS THE LOSS ON THE DODGE CITY BONDS IN QUESTION. OTHER CLAIMS WERE DENIED TO CLAIMANT. THE ARBITRATOR STATED THAT THE DODGE CITY BOND WAS NOT A SUITABLE INVESTMENT FOR THE CLAIMANT OR MET HIS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. CLAIMANT PURCHASED SAID BONDS WITH OFFICIAL STATEMENT BUT CLAIMED THAT HE NEVER READ THE OS. EVEN THOUGH HE HAD EXPERIENCED LOSSES ON OTHER BOND HOLDINGS, HE CLAIMED TO NOT BE AWARE OF THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH 10R BONDS. CLAIMANT HAD INSTRUCTED ME TO SELL AA RATED HOLDINGS TO PURCHASE THE DODGE CITY BONDS AGAINST MY RECOMMENDATION TO INCREASE HIS YIELD. EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO INDICATION OR REVELATION OF [CUSTOMER] FINANCIAL MEANS THE ARBITRATOR DETERMINED THAT THE INVESTMENT WAS TOO SPECULATIVE FOR THE INVESTOR.""
