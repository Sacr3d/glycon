WE TRANSFERRED FROM ON ANNUITY TO A HARTFORD ANNUITY BECAUSE OF THE WITHDRAWL BENEFIT PROVIDED THROUGH PRINCIPAL 1ST.  THIS FEATURE WAS DISCUSSED NUMEROUS TIMES WITH BOTH CLIENTS AS TO HOW THE PRINCIPAL 1ST WORKED.  THE CONTRACT IS STILL IN FORCE AND HAS INCREASED IN VALUE.  I HAD NO NOTICE ANYTHING WAS WRONG PRIOR TO THIS.""
