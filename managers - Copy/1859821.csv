LIBMAN DEPOSITED THE CHECK INTO HIS PERSONAL CHECKING ACCOUNT. LIBMAN WITHDREW $200,000 OF THE FUNDS AND INVESTED THE FUNDS IN A PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTION PURSUANT TO A PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT WITH A COMPANY. LIBMAN RECEIVED COMPENSATION FROM THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTION. LIBMAN FAILED TO NOTIFY THE FIRM IN WRITING, AND OBTAIN ITS PRIOR APPROVAL PRIOR TO MAKING THE INVESTMENT. THE AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY WAS AN OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITY FOR LIBMAN AND HE RECEIVED COMPENSATION AS A RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT. LIBMAN DID NOT PROVIDE ANY NOTICE TO HIS MEMBER FIRM ABOUT THE OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITY. FOLLOWING THE COMPANY'S COLLAPSE, THE FIRM SENT A QUESTIONNAIRE TO ITS BROKERS ASKING WHETHER THEY INVESTED THEIR OWN FUNDS IN THE COMPANY, REFERRED ANY INDIVIDUAL TO THE COMPANY, ADVISED ANYONE TO INVEST IN THE COMPANY, OR FACILITATED ANY INVESTMENT INTO THE COMPANY. LIBMAN'S RESPONSE TO THE FIRM'S QUESTIONNAIRE WAS FALSE BECAUSE HE STATED HE USED PERSONAL MONEY TO INVEST; HE DID NOT INVEST HIS OWN FUNDS; INSTEAD, HE INVESTED THOSE OF HIS FRIEND. FURTHER, LIBMAN'S RESPONSE WAS MISLEADING BECAUSE IT FAILED TO ADDRESS WHETHER HE REFERRED ANYONE TO THE COMPANY, ADVISED ANYONE TO INVEST IN COMPANY, OR FACILITATED ANY INVESTMENT INTO COMPANY. LIBMAN PROVIDED FALSE TESTIMONY TO FINRA AND REFUSED TO PROVIDE COMPLETE INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS TO FINRA. LIBMAN'S COUNSEL ALSO INFORMED FINRA THAT LIBMAN WOULD NO LONGER COOPERATE WITH ITS INVESTIGATION."",

LIBMAN FAILED TO NOTIFY HIS MEMBER FIRM IN WRITING AND OBTAIN ITS APPROVAL PRIOR TO MAKING THE INVESTMENT. LIBMAN RECEIVED COMPENSATION FROM THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTION. FINRA REQUESTED THAT LIBMAN PROVIDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ALL RECORDS FOR ALL BANK ACCOUNTS AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS IN WHICH HE HAD AN INTEREST. IN RESPONSE, LIBMAN PRODUCED CERTAIN MONTHLY STATEMENTS AND COPIES OF CERTAIN CHECKS DRAWN FROM HIS ACCOUNTS, BUT FAILED TO PROVIDE ANY COPIES OF CHECKS DEPOSITED INTO THE ACCOUNTS. LIBMAN, THROUGH HIS COUNSEL, REFUSED TO PROVIDE FINRA COPIES OF ALL CHECKS DEPOSITED INTO HIS ACCOUNTS. FINRA AGAIN REQUESTED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PERTAINING TO LIBMAN'S DEPOSITS AND SPECIFICALLY PERTAINING TO THE DEPOSIT OF $202,673.58, TO INCLUDE THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON OR THE ENTITY PROVIDING THE FUNDS AND THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE FUNDS WERE PROVIDED TO LIBMAN. FINRA ALSO REQUESTED THAT LIBMAN IDENTIFY EACH DEPOSIT THAT INCLUDED FUNDS OBTAINED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM AN INDIVIDUAL. LIBMAN, THROUGH HIS COUNSEL, REFUSED TO PROVIDE FINRA THE REQUESTED BANK DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION RELATING TO THE BANK DEPOSITS. LIBMAN'S COUNSEL ALSO INFORMED FINRA THAT LIBMAN WOULD NO LONGER COOPERATE WITH THE INVESTIGATION. WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE ALLEGATIONS, LIBMAN CONSENTED TO THE DESCRIBED SANCTION AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS; THEREFORE HE IS BARRED FROM ASSOCIATION WITH ANY FINRA MEMBER IN ANY AND ALL CAPACITIES.""
