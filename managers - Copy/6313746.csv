  ""Broker Comment"" : ""At the age of 13 around the year 1994 I was a minor shopping at the mall with other friends.  I was with several friends who took 2 t-shirts from a store in the Citadel Mall.  Since I was with them when they were caught I was also given a misdemeanor charge.  This has since been expunged from my records since I was a minor at the time.  I had to do 8 hours of community service and pay $200 fine.""
