  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Zito consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he participated in private securities transactions without providing prior written notice to his member firm. The findings stated that Zito invested in Madison Timber Properties, LLC (MTP) steadily generally holding three promissory notes with staggered maturities simultaneously. As one note matured, he moved the returned principal into a new note. The SEC filed a complaint against MTP and its owner alleging that the company was a Ponzi scheme that bilked at least 150 investors out of $85 million. MTP's owner pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to his role in the Ponzi scheme. Zito also recommended MTP to one of his customers at his firm. This customer maintained investments in three promissory notes simultaneously, which accounted for a consistent principal outlay of $1.0 million. This pattern continued for nearly five years, until the Ponzi scheme unraveled, during which the customer invested in 15 promissory notes totaling $5 million. Zito received nearly $100,000 in compensation as commissions on the customer's investments. Zito submitted four annual certifications to his firm in which he denied recommending any offerings or private securities transactions that were not offered through the firm. The findings also stated that Zito received compensation as a result of engaging in an outside business activity without ever disclosing that fact to his member firm. Zito was involved in trying to help MTP's owner find underwriting for a notional private-placement equity offering related to MTP. He inquired of various financial firms about their potential interest in the offering and arranged a meeting between the offering's backers and representatives of a local business-advisory firm. Although MTP engaged the business-advisory firm, the notional private-placement offering never came to fruition. Nonetheless, Zito began receiving sporadic payments from MTP as compensation for his efforts. Even though the offering never raised any money, MTP continued these payments to Zito, in varying amount and intervals, until they totaled nearly $130,000. Zito also submitted five annual certifications to his firm in which he denied being paid by any third party for business conducted outside the firm."",
