  ""Allegations"" : ""NASD RULE 2110: CAREY FAILED TO PROPERLY SAFEGUARD CUSTOMER BLOCK ORDER INFORMATION AND REFRAIN FROM CONDUCT THAT COULD DISADVANTAGE OR HARM THE EXECUTION OF HIS CUSTOMERS' BLOCK ORDERS. CAREY, AS A TRADER ON HIS FIRM'S INSTITUTIONAL SALES DESK, SOLICITED POTENTIAL CONTRA-SIDE PARTIES TO TAKE THE OTHER SIDE OF CUSTOMER BLOCK ORDERS. IN THE COURSE OF FINDING THE OTHER SIDE, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS CAREY PROVIDED A PURPORTED POTENTIAL CONTRA-PARTY WITH INFORMATION ABOUT BLOCK ORDERS THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. CAREY SHOULD NOT HAVE PROVIDED THIS INFORMATION TO THE CONTRA-PARTY BECAUSE IT DID NOT FURTHER THE GOAL OF OBTAINING BEST EXECUTION FOR ITS CUSTOMER. CAREY ALSO COULD HAVE DISADVANTAGED THE BLOCK ORDER CUSTOMER BY DISCLOSING THIS INFORMATION. CAREY DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT BASIS TO BELIEVE THAT THE CONTRA-PARTY WOULD TRADE IN A PORTION OF THE NUMEROUS BLOCK ORDERS, MUCH LESS DO SO IN A SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH SIZE TO RISK PROVIDING THE CONTRA-PARTY WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRICE AND SIZE OF THE BLOCK ORDER. FACTS INDICATED THAT THE CONTRA-PARTY LIKELY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD AN INTEREST IN BUYING OR SELLING THE SECURITY AND WAS NOT LIKELY TO TAKE A LARGE PORTION OF THE BLOCK ORDER IF IT DID DECIDE TO TRADE IN THE SECURITY. CAREY THEREFORE HAD INSUFFICIENT REASON TO BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING THE CONTRA-PARTY WITH THE ORDER INFORMATION WOULD ACHIEVE BEST EXECUTION FOR THE BLOCK ORDER CUSTOMER. THE CONTRA-PARTY USED THE INFORMATION IT RECEIVED FROM CAREY ABOUT THE BLOCK ORDERS TO FRONT-RUN THE BLOCK ORDER CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRA-PARTY TRADED ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE BLOCK ORDER BY AUTO-EXECUTING THROUGH A THIRD-PARTY DIRECT ACCESS PLATFORM. THE CONTRA-PARTY THEN SUBMITTED TO CAREY ORDERS ON THE CONTRA-SIDE OF THE CUSTOMER ORDER AND CAREY MANUALLY EXECUTED THOSE ORDERS. CAREY DID NOT SEE THE TRADES EXECUTED THROUGH THE DIRECT ACCESS PLATFORM. BY TRADING ON THE SAME SIDE OF PENDING BLOCK ORDERS, THE CONTRA-PARTY MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE A MORE FAVORABLE PRICE FOR THE SECURITIES, WHILE DEPRIVING THE BLOCK ORDER CUSTOMERS OF BEST EXECUTION FOR THEIR ORDERS."",
