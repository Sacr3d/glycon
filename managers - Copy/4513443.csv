  ""Firm Name"" : ""1.TIAA-CREF INDIVIDUAL & INSTITUTIONAL SERVICES LLC"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""A CLIENT COMPLAINT RECEIVED MAY 29 2014 ALLEGED THAT A RECOMMENDATION TO PURCHASE A TAX DEFERRED ANNUITY WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE CLIENT'S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND RESULTED IN THE REVERSAL OF THE TRANSACTION."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""PRIOR TO MAKING THE RECOMMENDATION OF A TAX-DEFERRED ANNUITY TO THIS CLIENT, THE CLIENT DID NOT FULLY ARTICULATE AND DISCLOSE HER TIME FRAME FOR THE USE OF THIS MONEY OR THE CONDITIONS SURROUNDING HER DISABILITY INCOME. HAD I KNOWN OR BEEN MADE AWARE OF EITHER, THIS PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN OFFERED. UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER THE TRANSFER FROM HER BROKERAGE ACCOUNT TO THE ANNUITY DID I LEARN ALL OF THE RELEVANT DETAILS. AT THAT TIME, TIAA-CREF WAS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY REVERSE THE TRANSACTION. ULTIMATELY NO HARM WAS IDENTIFIED, ALLEGED BY OR INFLICTED UPON THE CLIENT. HOWEVER, MY CAREER AS A PRODUCTIVE WEALTH MANAGEMENT ADVISOR AT TIAA-CREF CAME TO A SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED END WITHOUT ANY PRIOR NOTICE. WITH RESPECT TO MY SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED DEPARTURE FROM TIAA-CREF, I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO COMMENT, IT IS UNFORTUNATE WE ARRIVED AT THIS OUTCOME FOR I BELIEVE IT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THERE HAD BEEN A FORMAL REVIEW OR MENTORING PROCESS IN THE IMMEDIATE MONTHS FOLLOWING MY TRAINING. WHILE I REGRET THAT MY ACTIONS RESULTED IN THIS QUICK AND DECISIVE DECISION, I NEVER ONCE KNEW I WAS NOT FOLLOWING THE \""PROPER FIRM-APPROVED ADVICE DELIVERY MODEL.\"" OVER A NEARLY TWO-YEAR PERIOD, IT NEVER SURFACED AS A CONCERN NOR WAS IT EVER MENTIONED IN ANY OF MY FOUR FORMAL REVIEWS WITH LEADERSHIP. I SIMPLY WISH THAT I HAD BEEN ADEQUATELY NOTIFIED OF THE POLICY INFRACTION AND AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT IT. I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN WILLING TO ACCEPT A CONSTRUCTIVE ACTION PLAN IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVE MY VALUE TO MY CLIENTS AND THIS ORGANIZATION. I WAS A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AND RESPECTED ADVISOR, HAVING RANKED IN THE TOP 30% NATIONALLY IN 2013 AND WAS WELL ON MY WAY TO RANKING IN THE TOP 20% IN 2014.""
