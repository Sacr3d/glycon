THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT SECURITY (IDES) DETERMINED THAT \""SINCE THE CLAIMANT'S ACTION, WHICH RESULTED IN HIS DISCHARGE WAS NOT DELIBERATE OR WILLFUL, THE CLAIMANT IS ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS.\""  JPMORGANCHASE BANK THEN APPEALED THE LOCAL OFFICE'S DECISION OF MY ELIGIBILITY, AND A HEARING WAS SCHEDULED BY IDES WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE SELECTED BY IDES.  AFTER THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE HEARD TESTIMONY BY BOTH JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, IT'S AGENT AND MYSELF ON 2/18/16, THE JUDGE ENTERED A DECISION ON 2/19/2016 THAT \""THE LOCAL OFFICE DETERMINATION IS AFFIRMED.
