  ""Broker Comment"" : ""FA CLAIMS SHE EXPLAINED AND DISCLOSED THE PRICING OF THE ILLINOIS STATE BUILD AMERICA BOND SHE PRESENTED TO THE CLIENT.  FA STATES SHE PROVIDED A QUOTE HANDOUT, WHICH STATES THE BOND IS SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY AND PRICE CHANGE.  FA ALSO CLAIMS SHE EXPLAINED, BASED ON THE POSSIBILITY OF MARKET FLUCTUATION, THE CLIENT MIGHT NOT GET THE FULL $25,000.00 WORTH SINCE THE BOND WAS BEING SOLD IN $5,000.00 INCREMENTS. THE FA STATES BOTH THE HUSBAND AND WIFE WERE INSISTENT THEY DID NOT WANT TO TRANSFER ANY MORE THAN $25,000.00 INTO THEIR ACCOUNT.  FA STATES, SHE AGAIN EXPLAINED, DEPENDING ON THE PRICE OF THE BOND THEY MAY GET LESS THAN $25,000.00 WORTH, AND THE REMAINING FUNDS WOULD BE PUT IN MONEY MARKET. ACCORDING TO THE FA THE CLIENTS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED TO HER RECOMMENDATION.  THE FA ALSO STATES SHE EXPLAINED EDWARD JONES OFFERS A CREDIT CARD WHICH HAS PERKS AND BENEFITS.  THE FA STATES SHE PROVIDED THE CLIENT THE DISCLOSURE RELATED TO THE CREDIT CARD ALONG WITH THE NEW ACCOUNT PAPERWORK.  FA CLAIMS, SHE EXPLAINED, IF THEY DIDN'T WANT THE CREDIT CARD ONCE THEY RECEIVED IT, THEY COULD CANCEL IT.  THE FA CLAIMS THERE WAS NOT INDICATION THE CLIENTS DID NOT WANT THE CARD SO SHE PROCEEDED WITH THE APPLICATION FOR IT.  FINALLY, THE FA WAS ON MATERNITY LEAVE, WHICH IS TECHNICALLY DISABILITY WHEN THE CLIENTS WANTED TO SPEAK WITH HER.  WHEN AN ASSOCIATE IS ON DISABILITY THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM CONDUCTING BUSINESS; THEREFORE, SHE COULD NOT RETURN THEIR CALL.  BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE, WE BELIEVE THE FA EXPLAINED AND DISCLOSED THE BOND PRICING AS WELL AS THE CREDIT CARD INFORMATION TO THE CLIENT.""
