  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ACCORDING TO FA, WHEN HE MET WITH CLIENT ON MAY 1, 2006 HE HAD EXPRESSED HIS DESIRE TO DISCUSS RETIREMENT PLANNING.  FA INDICATED HE REVIEWED CLIENT'S FINANCIAL SITUATION WITH HIM AND DUE TO CLIENT'S INCOME THERE WERE LIMITATIONS ON RETIREMENT OPTIONS.  FA ALSO INDICATED CLIENT WAS CONTRIBUTING THE MAXIMUM TO A THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN AND, THEREFORE, THE FA DISCUSSED THE OPTION OF A LIFE INSURANCE RETIREMENT PLAN (LIRP) WITH THE PRIMARY BENEFIT TO THE CLIENT BEING THE POSSIBILITY OF TAX-FREE INCOME AT RETIREMENT.  FA STATED A 2ND APPT WAS SCHEDULED TO GIVE CLIENT TIME TO REVIEW THE OPTION OF THE LIRP AND CONSIDER THE AMOUNT HE WANTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE POLICY.  FA INDICATED AN ILLUSTRATION WAS CREATED, HE REVIEWED IT WITH THE CLIENT AND THE DECISION WAS MADE TO PROCEED WITH THIS TYPE OF POLICY.  OUR RECORDS REFLECT CLIENT SIGNED THE ILLUSTRATION ON JUNE 7, 2006, WHICH ACKNOWLEDGED CLIENT'S UNDERSTANDING AND RECEIPT OF THE ILLUSTRATION AND PROSPECTUS.  IN CLIENT'S LETTER HE INDICATED CONCERN REGARDING THE OPTION OF AN INCREASING DEATH BENEFIT.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THIS OPTION INCREASES THE COST OF THE POLICY AND, THE OBJECTIVE OF A LIRP IS TO INCREASE THE CASH VALUE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A RETIREMENT INCOME.  WHILE THE CONCERNS OUTLINED IN YOUR LETTER SURROUND THE DEATH BENEFIT, IT DOES NOT APPEAR THIS WAS A PRIMARY ISSUE WITH THE CLIENT AT THE TIME THE POLICY WAS ISSUED.  LASTLY, TO ADDRESS CLIENT'S CONCERN RELATED TO THE RATING HE RECEIVED, THE RATING WAS DETERMINED BY HARTFORD LIFE (LAB RESULTS).  BASED ON OUR REVIEW, IT APPEARS THE DETAILS OF A LIRP WERE EXPLAINED IN DETAIL BY THE FA AND THIS PRODUCT MET HIS RETIREMENT PLANNING NEEDS.  AS A RESULT, WE RESPECTFULLY DENY CLIENT'S REQUEST TO REFUND ANY PREMIUMS PAID.""
