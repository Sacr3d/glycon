  ""Allegations"" : ""On June 15, 1993, a Consent Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (\""Consent Order\"") was entered against Respondent Alan S. Wardyga (\""Wardyga\""), a sole proprietor doing business as Wealth Management Resources and located in Lincoln, RI. The Consent Order, entered following receipt of a written Offer of Settlement from Wardyga reflecting the express understanding that such offer was for the purposes of settlement only and that such Offer did not constitute an admission of guilt or wrongdoing, made effective the licensing of Wardyga as an investment adviser and investment adviser representative and ordered him to cease and desist from any further violation of the licensing requirements of the Rhode Island Uniform Securities Act (\""RIUSA\""). The Consent Order reflects a finding by the Director of the Department of Business Regulation that, without effective licensing, Wardyga had transacted business as an investment adviser representative by soliciting for the sale of investment advisory services. Respondents have disclosed the Consent Order on Form U-4 and in Part I of Form ADV in accordance with the requirements of RIUSA. From April 8, 1996, to the present, Respondents have failed to disclose the Consent Order to clients and prospective clients. The Director finds this to be a violation of RI law because such disclosure should have been made either in Part II of Form ADV, Respondents' brochure, or other written notification. Respondents have disputed that RI law requires that such disclosure should have been made either in Part II of Form ADV, Respondents' brochure, or other written notification. In order to conserve resources and to avoid a protracted dispute of the issue, the Director and Respondents hereby agree for the purposes of this Order that Respondents' failure to disclose the Consent Order shall be considered an unintentional, technical violation of RIUSA. Respondents cooperated fully in the inquiry *See FAQ #1*"",
