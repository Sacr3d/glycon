  ""Broker Comment"" : ""[Customer's] parents [third party] 20 year + clients of mine funded [customer's] account as a gift. [Customer] never put any of his own money into the account. The account always used margin as leverage and invested in higher yielding securities. [Customer] was sent regular checks as income.  After 4/29/2013 his NLY dividends were just used to pay down margin balance so when he called me to liquidate  his account on 3/23/2015 his margin balance was down to $936.85 which of course had to paid from sale proceeds. He had NO MARGIN CALLS during the time frame of his spurious complaint.  Had he held his stock he would have received 6 more $72.00 dividends by now $432.00 more. The stock closed yesterday at the same price he sold it at. NLY is a high income mortgage REIT dividend stock.  I met annually and spoke almost daily to his parents. I spoke infrequently but certainly explained transactions and dividends to him including the cessation of sending dividend checks to pay down margin to [customer] as there was virtually no activity in his account. His statements were both regular and easy to read as there were only 2 small purchases and the final sale other than dividends and very small margin monthly charges (the last being $3.33 as margin interest kept going down as margin was being paid off)   in the 5 year period in his \""complaint\""""
