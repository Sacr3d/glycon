  ""Firm Name"" : ""David Fitzgerald"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Registered Representative acknowledged entering inaccurate information into a firm system regarding the manner of his communications with firm clients."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""\""The firm mandated that I contact my clients via phone a certain number of times every month. Notably, my manager instructed me to log calls with clients even if no contact had actually taken place. After building a relationship with my clients, some of them specifically requested to communicate with me via e-mail. As part of my client service responsibilities, I felt it was necessary to at least explore the option. As this constituted a minor deviation from the firm's standard operating procedure, I felt it prudent to ask my manager whether following my clients' wishes in this regard was appropriate. He told me in no uncertain terms that there were no issues with adhering to the clients' requests. As a direct result of my manager's confirmation that this practice would be acceptable, I started to e-mail the applicable clients instead of calling. In the firm's system, I recorded the e-mails as phone calls, and the firm terminated me as a result.* No clients were harmed or affected.\""""
