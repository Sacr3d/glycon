  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN RESPONSE TO THE SETTLEMENT MADE BY CHASE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE FOLLOWING:  FIRST, CHASE IS INACCURATE; MY CLIENT MADE NO CLAIM. THE CLAIM WAS MADE BY HER BROTHER, A FINANCIAL ADVISOR AT MERRILL LYNCH. SUFFICE IT TO SAY HE WAS NOT HAPPY WITH HIS SISTER'S DECISION TO INVEST WITH ME.    SECOND, I DID NOT AGREE TO ANY SETTLEMENT; I WANTED TO HAVE THE CLAIM ARBITRATED. THE SETTLEMENT WAS ENTIRELY THE DECISION OF CHASE MANAGEMENT.  THIRD, THE BROTHER CALLED UPPER MANAGEMENT AT CHASE (EVP/CEO OF RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES) AND MADE HIS COMPLAINT ORALLY. THERE WAS NO WRITTEN COMPLAINT FILED BY ANYONE.  FOURTH, THE SETTLEMENT WAS MADE WITHIN A WEEK OF HIS CALL; NO ONE AT CHASE EVER SPOKE TO MY CLIENT. I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF SETTLING A MATTER SUCH AS THIS IN ONLY A WEEK.""
