WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD APPRECIATE FASTER IN A TIME OF DECREASING INTEREST RATES BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THE BONDS DECREASED IN VALUE OVER THE SHORT-TERM. IN LESS THAN A YEAR, THE BONDS HAD INCREASED OVER 10% IN VALUE.  THE ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT THAT CUSTOMERS WERE CONSIDERING WAS MUTUAL FUNDS.  THEY COULD HAVE LOST 15% DURING THE SAME PERIOD. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A 10% PROFIT AND A 15% LOSS WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT AN $85000.00 DIFFERENCE IN THEIR RETURN.""
