  ""Firm Name"" : ""PARNASSUS FUNDS DISTRIBUTOR"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Voluntary Resignation"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""VIOLATION OF COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REQUIRING PRIOR APPROVAL OF MARKETING PRESENTATIONS BY ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT AND COMPLIANCE PRINCIPAL."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I left Parnassus on very positive terms. In the process of my resignation from Parnassus, the Parnassus compliance department advised that a few separate institutional account marketing presentations had not been approved by the appropriate firm personnel. Parnassus' common practice was for the marketing team to prepare the presentations and appropriate firm personnel would sign off on those presentations prior to use. In a few instances, the marketing team created the presentations using data that had been previously approved by appropriate firm personnel. Those presentations were presented to a few institutional accounts however the compliance department had not approved the final presentations.  There was no allegation that the data was manipulated to mislead the institutional accounts. Rather, the data presented was incorrect in favor of the industry benchmarks versus the Parnassus' fund performance.""
