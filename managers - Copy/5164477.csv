  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The client called customer service requesting rollover paperwork to move her account into an IRA and was advised to contact me about IRA options within the company while she waited to receive the paperwork. I discussed the ability for her to change her 403b into an IRA internally which would keep the account surrender charge free and include all of the same investment options. The client said she was working with an advisor and didn't want to meet with me in person because she would follow her advisor's advice but to go ahead and send the internal rollover form just in case. Three weeks later I received the paperwork back that was dated the day she received it and then I forwarded them on to the school corporation for plan administrator signature. While waiting for the school corporation to complete the paperwork the client called and was unhappy that the process was taking so long because she wanted the account moved into an IRA immediately so she could then move the account to her outside advisor. The school corporation sat on the paperwork for 2 weeks and the paperwork became stale-dated. Since the client was in a hurry to move the account I used her original signature to complete an electronic version in order to get the transaction approved using current dates and not delaying the processing by sending out new paperwork. I did not change any details of the contracts that were discussed. There wasn't any compensation for this internal transaction so there wasn't any advantage for me other than getting the transaction processed for the client. This was the wrong thing to do but there was zero intent to harm the client in any way. I recognize that I made a mistake here, and I will never take a short-cut like this again.""

  ""Allegations"" : ""A variable annuity contract was issued to the customer on August 17, 2016, and received by her on August 29. On September 9, 2016, the variable annuity sponsor received a letter from the customer dated September 6 asking that the contract be cancelled pursuant to her twenty-day right to examine the contract. In the letter the client stated she was revoking the contract because she had not authorized electronic signatures and had never electronically placed her signature and initials on the paperwork. The product sponsor cancelled the contract on September 20, 2016. However, the Firm was not notified of the forgery allegations until the client called in on November 17, 2016, and brought her complaint, including the letter she had written, to the Firm's attention."",
