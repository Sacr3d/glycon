  ""Broker Comment"" : ""WHILE VISITING A FRIEND OUT TOWN I WAS INVOLVED IN AN AUTO ACCIDENT WHICH TOTALED MY CAR AND BROKE MY FOOT.  AS A RESULT OF THE BROKEN FOOT I WAS IN A CAST UP TO MY KNEE AND BECAUSE OF MY TOTALED CAR HAD NO TRANSPORTATION.  IT WAS SNOWING AND THE WEATHER WAS BAD AND I COULD NOT TRAVEL FOR ABOUT A WEEK.  CONSEQUENTLY MY AFFAIRS AT HOME WERE UNATTENDED AND I WAS NOT MAKING ANY MONEY BECAUSE AS A HAIRSTYLIST I COULD NOT STAND ON MY FEET.  AS SOON AS I RETURNED TO VA BEACH A POLICEMAN BROUGHT A SUMMONS TO MY DOOR AND IT WAS TOO LATE TO TAKE CARE OF THE MATTER OUT OF COURT.  I WAS APPOINTED AN ATTORNEY WHO ADVISED THE BEST THING TO DO WAS PLEAD GUILTY TO A MISDEMEANOR.""
