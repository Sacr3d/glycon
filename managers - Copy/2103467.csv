The findings stated that Millman certified, on an annual basis, that she understood the requirement to keep her Form U4 current and agreed to tell her supervisor within 30 days of any event that may require an affirmative answer on her Form U4. The findings also stated that Millman borrowed $6,000 from a member firm customer without providing prior notice to or obtaining prior written approval from the firm. The customer wrote a personal check for $6,000 to Millman with the agreement that the loan would be repaid within a few months with 3% interest. Millman repaid the customer after the customer contacted the firm and notified it of the loan."",
