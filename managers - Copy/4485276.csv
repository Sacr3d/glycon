  ""Broker Comment"" : ""On 2/11/2011 I signed a loan agreement with Stock Loan Services. The loan was for $37,500 and requested quarterly payments. I made all payments on time and was current on the loan. In July of 2012 Stock Loan requested that I make a lump sum payment of $13,000 to settle the debt. They desired a lower lump sum in lie of future payments. To clarify, I did not request a settlement, a compromise or any change to the original note. The offer letter and satisfaction of debt letter from Stock Loan Services is available for review at any time.""
