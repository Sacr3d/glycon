  ""Allegations"" : ""WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, LEVORCHICK CONSENTED TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT HE NEGLIGENTLY MISREPRESENTED TO HIS CUSTOMER THAT THE LIQUIDATION OF HER VARIABLE ANNUITY WOULD NOT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT TAX LIABILITY. BECAUSE THE LIQUIDATION RESULTED IN A SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL GAIN, HOWEVER, THE CUSTOMER INCURRED A TAX LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $20,000. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS TAX CONSEQUENCE, LEVORCHICK'S RECOMMENDATION TO LIQUIDATE THE VARIABLE ANNUITY WAS UNSUITABLE. ALSO LEVORCHICK WAS NEGLIGENT IN MAKING THIS REPRESENTATION TO THE CUSTOMER BECAUSE AT THE TIME IT WAS MADE, HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE LIQUIDATION OF THE VARIABLE ANNUITY WOULD RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL GAIN FOR HER, AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE, A SIGNIFICANT TAX LIABILITY. THE CUSTOMER EVENTUALLY WAS COMPENSATED BY LEVORCHICK AND THE MEMBER FIRM FOR THE TAX EXPENSE SHE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE UNSUITABLE LIQUIDATION OF THE VARIABLE ANNUITY."",
