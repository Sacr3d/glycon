  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Review of tax return identifies a gross error.  My attorney has refiled the return and has advised me that as soon as the amended return is filed that the IRS will drop the lien. As the dates indicate, I wasn't notified of the lien until after it was filed. The filed/amended return reflects a refund of over $17K versus my owing $20.""
