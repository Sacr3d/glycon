Also named in the action was Insurance Trends, Inc., an entity controlled by Booth.  Most recently and from 2018 to 2019, Respondent Booth had been registered as a broker-dealer agent and investment adviser agent of LPL Financial LLC in Connecticut.  While those registrations had previously been withdrawn, Connecticut law permits the Commissioner to initiate revocation proceedings within one year after the withdrawal becomes effective.  The action alleged that, from 2013 to 2019, Booth violated the antifraud provisions in Section 36b-4(a) of the Connecticut Uniform Securities Act and engaged in dishonest or unethical practices while associated with his past two employing firms.  More specifically, respondent Booth allegedly solicited firm clients to invest in outside opportunities and send their funds to Insurance Trends, Inc.  The action also alleged that respondent Booth then used investor funds for his personal expenses and that he fabricated client account statements to reflect investments that were, in fact, never made.  Booth allegedly misappropriated approximately $5 million in investor funds."",

Booth had been the subject of a February 14, 2020 Order to Cease and Desist, Order to Make Restitution, Notice of Intent to Fine, Notice of Intent to Revoke Registration as a Broker-dealer Agent and Investment Adviser Agent and Notice of Right to Hearing (Docket No. CDFR-20-8535-S).

The action had also alleged that respondent Booth then used investor funds for his personal expenses and that he fabricated client account statements to reflect investments that were, in fact, never made.  Booth allegedly misappropriated approximately $5 million in investor funds.  Since respondent Booth did not request a hearing on the Order to Cease and Desist and the Order to Make Restitution, those orders became permanent as to him on March 12, 2020.  Similarly, respondent Booth did not request a hearing on the Notice of Intent to Fine or the Notice of Intent to Revoke Registration as a Broker-dealer Agent and as an Investment Adviser Agent.  Consequently, the Commissioner's June 18, 2020 order was entered by default.  Adopting as findings the allegations in the February 14, 2020 action, the Commissioner fined Booth $100,000 and revoked Booth's broker-dealer agent and investment adviser agent registrations.""

  ""Allegations"" : ""On September 30, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut issued this complaint as to Respondent James T. Booth. Plaintiff SEC files this Complaint against defendant Booth and alleges as follows: Booth conducted a multi-year scheme that defrauded approximately 40 investors out of nearly $4 million. Booth made false or misleading statements to retail investors, telling them their assets would be used to purchase securities. Instead, Booth pocketed the investors' money, using the investors' money to pay personal and business expenses and, from time to time, to pay prior investors in order to keep the scheme going. Many of Booth's clients and customers were unsophisticated investors, including seniors who utilized Booth's services for their retirement savings. In furtherance of the scheme, Booth fabricated elaborate account statements, which were provided to the investors. The fabricated account statements reflected various ownership positions, transactions and earnings, all to create the false appearance that the investors' money had been invested as promised; some statements even included fictitious securities and values. When investors requested withdrawals, Booth routinely used assets fraudulently acquired from other investors to cover those withdrawals. As a result of the conduct alleged herein, the Defendant violated, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\""Exchange Act\"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\""Securities Act\""); and, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\""Advisers Act\"")."",
