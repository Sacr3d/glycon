A SIMILAR CASE FOR A LARGER AMOUNT WAS FILED BY HER HUSBAND ([SPOUSE]) AND WENT TO AN ARBITRATION PANEL, WHERUPON ALL CLAIMS WERE DISMISSED AS BEING WITHOUT MERIT. GIVEN THE EXPENSE OF TIME AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION OF THIS PRIOR CASE, IT WAS JUDGED TO MORE PRUDENT TO SETTLE THE SMALLER AMOUNT. WHILE ECONOMIC DECISION WAS MADE IN SETTLEMENT, ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE STILL DENIES ANY WRONG DOING (ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE EXONERATION OF SIMILAR CHARGES IN THE DISMISSED CASE).""
