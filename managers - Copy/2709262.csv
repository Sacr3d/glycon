  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ACCORDING TO FA, CLIENT HAD BEEN REFERRED TO HIM BY HER ATTORNEY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PURCHASING AN IMMEDIATE ANNUITY.  FA INDICATED HE SPENT TIME WITH THE CLIENT DISCUSSING THE ANNUITY OPTIONS (I.E. PAYOUT OPTIONS) AND THE OUTCOME OF HER CHOICES.  FA STATED HE INFORMED THE CLIENT THAT IN CHOOSING AN IMMEDIATE ANNUITY SHE WAS RELINQUISHING THE MONEY IN RETURN FOR AN INCOME FOR HER LIFE (5 YEAR PERIOD CERTAIN).  OUR RECORDS REFLECT THE CLIENT ACCEPTED THIS IMMEDIATE ANNUITY ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2005 (PER HER SIGNATURE ON THE DELIVERY RECEIPT).  WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THE CLIENT'S FRUSTRATION THAT SHE DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE FUNDS DEPOSITED INTO THE IMMEDIATE ANNUITY, SHE HAS BEEN RECEIVING A MONTHLY INCOME OF $1,635.81 FROM GENWORTH FOR APPROXIMATELY 18 MONTHS.  BASED ON OUR REVIEW, IT APPEARS PROPER DISCLOSURE WAS MADE RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF THE IMMEDIATE ANNUITY AND, THEREFORE, WE RESPECTFULLY DENY THE ATTORNEY'S REQUEST TO TERMINATE THIS CONTRACT.""
