  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I USED A SALES TECHNIQUE THAT IS COMMON IN THE VA INDUSTRY TO HELP ADVISORS REVIEW OLD ANNUITY CONTRACTS THAT THEIR CLIENTS OWN. I WAS INSTRUCTED TO DO SO BY MY EXTERNAL PARTNER, AND WOULD ONLY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CONDUCT THESE REVIEWS WITH THE PERMISSION (OFTEN TIMES AT THE REQUEST OF) A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. BOTH OF MY DIRECT MANAGERS KNEW THAT I WAS CONDUCTING THIS PRACTICE ON A REGULAR BASIS. FOR MONTHS I WAS ABLE TO CONDUCT THIS PRACTICE WITHOUT ANY ORDER, DIRECTION, OR EVEN SUGGESTION TO STOP FROM MY MANAGERS. WHEN MY EXTERNAL PARTNER LEFT SUNAMERICA IN A MANNER THAT UPSET MANAGMENT, I WAS TOLD (THREE DAYS AFTER MY PARTNERS RESIGNATION) THAT MY PHONE CALLS WERE BEING REVIEWED FOR INAPPROPRIATE SALES PRACTICES. I BECAME A VICTIM OF CORPORATE POLITICS.""
