  ""Type"" : ""Bankruptcy"",
  ""Disposition"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Filed Chapter 13 in September 2012 to modify mortgage's on a rental property and our primary residence both of which had large amounts of negative equity.  Also, had a disabled child who needed extensive medical care which depleted a large portion of my liquid cash assets. This child is now deceased.  Chapter 13  was completed and discharged in 2017.  Up until filing I never had any late payments and had perfect credit.  This was a decision not taken lightly but was deemed necessary in order to keep my real estate.""
