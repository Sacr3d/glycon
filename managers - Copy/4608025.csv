THE CLIENT WAS REASSIGNED BY VALIC TO CHRIS SCARBOROUGH, WHO IS MENTIONED BY NAME DIRECTLY IN THE COMPLAINT. VALIC WILL HAVE A COPY OF THE ANNUITY TRANSACTION DISCLOSURE FORM THAT WAS SIGNED BY THE CLIENT LISTING ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS WHY THE TRANSACTION WAS APPROPRIATE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS COMPLAINT SHOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME WHATSOEVER AS THE ISSUE OCCURRED 5 YEARS AFTER I LEFT THE SELLING BROKER/DEALER, AND HIS SITUATION OBVIOUSLY CHANGED WHILE I WAS EMPLOYED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET HELP FROM THE ACTIVE ADVISOR.""
