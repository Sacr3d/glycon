  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I am working with AFS to correct this disclosure.  AFS\\u00c2\\u00bf disclosure is false and entirely without merit. AFS alleges (1) \\u00c2\\u00bfI\\u00c2\\u00bf (2) \\u00c2\\u00bfsubmitted\\u00c2\\u00bf an (3) \\u00c2\\u00bfapplication\\u00c2\\u00bf that contained non-genuine (4) \\u00c2\\u00bfsignatures,\\u00c2\\u00bf implying (5) untoward conduct.
