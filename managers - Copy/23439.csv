  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE ARBITRATION AWARD DID NOT FIND THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE LIABLE AND DID NOT REQUIRE HIM TO FINANCIALLY COMPENSATE THE CLAIMANT.  DESPITE CLAIMANT'S ALLEGED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND THE ARBITRATION AWARD, THE CLAIMANT DID NOT ACTUALLY LOSE ANY MONEY IN HER INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS.  IN FACT, DURING HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE THE CLAIMANT HAD A NET GAIN IN HER INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS.  THE FIRM PLANS TO FILE A MOTION TO VACATE THE ARBITRATION AWARD AS IT BELIEVES THE ARBITRATION PANEL MANIFESTLY DISREGARDED THE LAW AS IT APPLIES TO THIS MATTER.""
