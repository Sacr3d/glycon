  ""Broker Comment"" : ""AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH [CUSTOMER] AND PRESENTING MULTIPLE OPTIONS FOR HER TO ROLLOVER HER SMITH BARNEY IRA TO ANOTHER SOLUTION WITH VALIC, SHE CHOSE PDA (A VALIC ANNUITY PRODUCT WITH A FIVE YEAR SURRENDER.)  SHE SIGNED AND INITIALED A VALIC ANNUITY TRANSACTION DISCLOSURE FORM THAT INDICATED THE SURRENDER CHARGES CLEARLY ON THIS FORM ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER FEES, RISKS, CHARGES, ETC.  I STILL STAND FIRM WITH MY OPINION THAT [CUSTOMER] WAS IN NO WAY EVERY MISLED OR MISINFORMED, SHE CHOSE THIS PRODUCT, NOT ME.  TO ME, BEING A VALIC FINANCIAL ADVISOR, IT DID NOT MATTER TO ME ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WHAT OPTION SHE CHOSE.  I PRESENTED SEVERAL OPTIONS AND MET WITH HER ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS SPENDING A TOTAL OF SEVERAL HOURS WITH HER AND THE END DECISION WAS HER DECISION TO ROLLOVER HER MONEY INTO THE VALIC PDA.  I PRESENTED THE FACTS, SHE SIGNED AND AFTER APPROXIMATELY 18 MONTHS OF BEING EXTREMELY HAPPY IN THE OPTION SHE CHOSE, SHE SPOKE TO A NIECE, WHO IS A FINANCIAL ADVISOR WITH EDWARD JONES AND THE NIECE ADVISED HER THE VALIC PDA WAS NOT A GOOD OPTION FOR HER AND IMMEDIATELY [CUSTOMER] DECIDED SHE SHOULD NOT BE IN THIS PRODUCT ANY LONGER AND TRIED TO HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE FOR HER ACTIONS. PRODUCT SPONSOR WAIVED SURRENDER CHARGES.""
