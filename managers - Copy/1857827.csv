  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The claims were baseless and filed in bad faith. There was no admission of guilt on any of the charges.  To avoid further litigation costs, KMS chose to settle the case for a \""nuisance amount\"" of $7,500. Mr. Carlini did not contribute to the settlement amount. Like most diversified portfolios, some investment positions decreased in value.  However, most positions increased in value and the overall investment account had a net INCREASE in value.  The account did not incur a loss and the investments were deemed suitable.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE COMPLAINT WAS SETTLED OUTSIDE OF ARBITRATION WITH NO ADMISSION OF WRONG DOING.  THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY WAS ACTUALLY DICTATED BY THE CLIENT WHO INSISTED THE ACCOUNT BE MANAGED MORE AGGRESSIVELY AND INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL STOCKS.  THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS AT RISK, HOWEVER, BECAUSE HE DID NOT UPDATE THE ACCOUNT GAOLS AS LISTED ON THE CLIENT PROFILE TO REFLECT THE MORE AGGRESSIVE NATURE LATER REQUESTED BY THE CLIENT. SOME STOCK TRADES WERE MADE WITHOUT FIRST DISCUSSING THE SPECIFICS WITH THE CLIENT, ALTHOUGH THEY WERE WITHIN THE OVERALL INVESTMENT STRATEGY DISCUSSED WITH THE CLIENT AND WERE NOT RESCINDED BY THE CLIENT ONCE THEY WERE MADE AWARE BY SUBSEQUENT PHONE CALL OR CONFIRMATION.  THE NET EFFECT OF SUCH TRADES WAS POSITIVE.  THE INJUSTICE IS THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SUCH LOSSES WHILE SIMILAR GAINS WERE IGNORED.""
