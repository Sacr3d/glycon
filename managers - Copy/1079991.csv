  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This action has been in negotiation for close to 10 years. The challenge  was that the original amount was somewhat short of the CITIBANC claim.  Evidently the first attorney in Dallas stopped working with CITIBANK and dropped the file. After the first attorney abandoned the file he did two things, 1) He disappeared, CITIBANK could not locate him and 2) he added his fees on top of the  balance that CITIBANK was negotiating with me. I protested loudly but never the less, I gave them the location of the old attorney. They had lost him and  I gave them the last known whereabouts of the guy. Time went on, I have been negotiating with CITIBANK through their new attorney in Lubbock. The payment was the result of a lengthy negotiation.""
