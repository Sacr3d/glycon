  ""Broker Comment"" : ""My wife and I both experienced job loss due to separate reductions in force between 2009 and 2011.  As a result we realized a significant loss of income.  We accumulated debt during this time, until it became a burden that we needed to resolve.  In October of 2014 we engaged Freedom Debt Solutions to help us consolidate our outstanding debt.  This item is one of the 9 creditors that we worked with in this program to negotiate a settlement to satisfy our debt.""
