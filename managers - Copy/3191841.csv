  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CLIENT CONTACTED OUR OFFICE AND WAS DIRECTED TO ME AS I WAS THE BROKER OF THE DAY.  THE CLIENT'S RISK TOLERANCE WAS AGGRESSIVE AND WAS INTERESTED IN INVESTING INDIVIDUAL STOCKS TO INCREASE HIS ACCOUNT VALUE.  THE CLIENT'S RISK TOLERANCE WAS REFLECTED IN VARIOUS NOTES AND SIGNED DOCUMENTS BY THE CLIENT.  THE EVENING BEFORE A STOCK TRADED PUBLICLY (AUGUST 2005), THE CLIENT REQUESTED THAT HIS ACCOUNT VALUE BE INVESTED IN THIS STOCK.  I WAS NOT ABLE TO EXECUTE THE ORDER AS INCOMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS WERE RECEIVED.  MY BRANCH MANAGER AND I SPOKE WITH THE CLIENT REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND THE MATTER WAS RESOLVED.  THE CLIENT CONTINUED TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME UNTIL MY RESIGNATION FROM THE FIRM IN JULY 2006.""
