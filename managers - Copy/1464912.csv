  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Upon review of the client's investment objective, investment experience, risk tolerance, suitability, among other factors, the rep made recommendations to purchase specific securities for the client.  The rep discussed market risk and gave the client a prospectus for each security.  When the investments were first purchased, the values were stable and the securities offered good income streams which according to the client was a priority.  Later on as energy and oil prices declined, so did the account's performance.  The rep talked regularly with the client during this volatility in the market and recommended holding the securities mainly because the dividend rates remained consistent providing predictable steady income.  Several energy industry reports explaining the current market conditions within the sector were forwarded to the client.  Unfortunately, due to uncontrollable market conditions the account's value declined.""
