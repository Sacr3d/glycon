IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT SINCE HIS ANNUAL DIVIDEND ON HIS OLD POLICY WAS $3,338.50. AND HIS ANNUAL PREMIUM WAS $3,575, HE USED IT TO REDUCE HIS PREMIUM, THE BALANCE BE PAID BY HIM. THE CUSTOMER HIS DAUGHTER WANTED TO KNOW IF WE COULD USE THE VALUES FROM THE EXISTING POLICY TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE IN THE ANNUAL PREMIUM.
