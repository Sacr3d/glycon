  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS INCIDENT HAS BEEN EXPUNGED FROM MY RECORDS; THEREFORE, I HAVE NEVER INCLUDED THIS INCIDENT ON MY U-4.  IT RECENTLY SURFACED AGAIN WHEN I APPLIED FOR AGENT STATUS IN AN ADDITIONAL STATE.  I CALLED JUSTICE ANDERSON, THE TOWN JUDGE OF RUSH, NY.  SHE INFORMED ME THAT UNDER NY STATE LAWS, THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN DROPPED, AND SHE HAS NO AVAILABLE RECORDS OF THE INCIDENT; I.E., IN HER WORDS, THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN EXPUNGED.  APPARENTLY, THE INCIDENT DOES REMAIN IN FBI FILES AND I WILL TAKE STEPS TO HAVE IT EXPUNGED FROM FBI RECORDS.""
