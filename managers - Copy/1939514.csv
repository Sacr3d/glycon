A CUSTOMER OPENED AN INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) WITH GOSSETT AT HIS FIRM AND LISTED GROWTH AS HIS PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, WITH SPECULATION AS HIS SECONDARY OBJECTIVE. GOSSETT MADE TRADES IN THE ACCOUNT INVOLVING PURCHASES OF UNSUITABLE PENNY STOCKS; THE STOCKS WERE UNSUITABLE ON THE BASIS OF THE CUSTOMER'S FINANCIAL SITUATION AND NEEDS. WHEN EFFECTING THE TRANSACTIONS, GOSSETT MARKED THE ORDER MEMORANDA FOR THE TRADES AS UNSOLICITED ORDERS WHEN, IN FACT, THEY WERE SOLICITED BY GOSSETT, THEREBY CAUSING HIS FIRM'S BOOKS AND RECORDS TO BE INACCURATE AND NOT COMPLIANT WITH SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT RULES 17A-3 AND 17A-4. GOSSETT EFFECTED THE TRANSACTIONS ON A DISCRETIONARY BASIS, WITHOUT THE CUSTOMER'S OR THE FIRM'S PRIOR WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION."",
