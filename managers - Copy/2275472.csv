FROM MARCH 1, 2000 INTO OCTOBER 2000, THE FUNDS' PORTFOLIOS INCLUDED SEVERAL MUNICIPAL BONDS THAT WERE VALUED BY THE FUNDS AT PRICES ABOVE THEIR FAIR VALUES. AS A RESULT, ON NUMEROUS DAYS THROUGHOUT THAT TIME PERIOD, THE FUNDS' NET ASSET VALUES (\""NAVS\"") WERE INCORRECT, THE FUNDS' SHARES WERE INCORRECTLY PRICED, AND INVESTORS PURCHASED AND REDEEMED FUND SHARES AT PRICES THAT BENEFITED REDEEMING INVESTORS AT THE EXPENSE OF REMAINING AND NEW INVESTORS. DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, INFORMATION WAS PRESENTED TO THE DIRECTORS WHICH SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE DIRECTORS,  THAT THE BONDS WERE BECOMING INCREASINGLY ILLIQUID AND MAY HAVE BEEN MISPRICED. AS A RESULT, THE DIRECTORS, SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE PRICES AT WHICH THE FUNDS CARRIED THEIR BONDS DID NOT REFLECT THE BONDS' \""FAIR VALUE\"" AS REQUIRED BY THE AFFILIATES PRICING PROCEDURES. THE FIRM WAS FORCED ON OCTOBER 13, 2000 TO DEVALUE THE BONDS, THEREBY RESULTING IN APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION IN MONETARY LOSSES TO SHAREHOLDERS. AS A RESULT OF THE NEGLIGENT CONDUCT DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT KENNETH J. DELLA (\""DELLA\"") AND OTHERS (COLLECTIVELY \""RESPONDENTS\"") WILLFULLY VIOLATED THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, AS FOLLOWS: SECTIONS 17(A)(2) AND 17(A)(3) OF THE SECURITIES ACT; AND AIDED AND ABETTED THE FIRM'S VIOLATION OF SECTION 206(2) OF THE ADVISERS ACT."",
