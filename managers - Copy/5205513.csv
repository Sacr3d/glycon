The client's investment was FDIC Insured and the pricipal was guaranteed when the investment was held to maturity.  At the time I was employed by The Huntington Investment Company It was a their practice to have  a licensed banker present in the branch that would meet with bank clients. Their duties were to work with clients in both a banker and a broker capacity.  I was not present during this meeting as the Senior Financial Advisor. The Huntington Investment Company's practice at that time was to have the Senior Advisor sign off on the transactions even if they were not present in the meeting.  The client was also provided with Market Linked CD disclosures to sign at the point of sale.""
