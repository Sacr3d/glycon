  ""Broker Comment"" : ""EVENT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE COMBINATION OF COLLEGE PRANK & MY OWN IMMATURITY. DUE TO PEER PRESSURE IN MY FIRST QUARTER OF COLLEGE, I WAS TOLD TO BUY SOME EMBARASSING MAGAZINES AS A GAG ON A FELLOW CLASSMATE. BEING TO EMBARASSED TO PURCHASE THEN I TOOK THEM FROM THE STORE. IT REALLY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH PAYING FOR THEM AS IT DID MY FEAR OF BEING SEEN BUYING THEM IN THE LOCAL TOWN. THE EVENT WAS THE ONLY TIME IN MY LIFE THAT ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAD HAPPENED AND IT REMAINS FIRMLY ENTRENCHED IN MY MIND AS A REMINDER OF HIGH PRESSURE PERIOD IN MY TEENS.""
