  ""Broker Comment"" : ""On or around February of 2014 I had met with the principal of Norwood Business Ventures regarding their existing investment account.  During this meeting the individual indicated that they would like the account to be positioned in a  more aggressive manner so as to have the opportunity to participate in the gains of the market.  We had discussed a few different investment recommendations and the principal preferred the recommendation that later was put in the account. The principal informed me that the organization would need to update its Investment Policy Statement in order to have the opportunity to position the account in a more aggressive manner.  During this time and until March of 2014 the principal had the investment policy statement amended.  Prior to the new allocation being placed in the organization's investment account, I had also met with the board of the organization. The board agreed with the principals choice of recommendations and collectively decided to move forward.  On or about March of 2014 the account was allocated as per the agreed recommendation.  The recommendations made to the client and the holdings in the clients account were consistent with the mandate of the clients Investment Policy Statement.""
