  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ACCORDING TO THE IR THE CLIENT'S INITIAL PURCHASE WAS IN 1997.  THE CLIENT WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY ON SEVERAL NAVY SEAL EVENTS BUT ACCORDING TO NOTES ON THE SYSTEM THE IR WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN SOME COMMUNICATION WITH THE CLIENT.  BASED UPON OUR REVIEW IT APPEARS THAT THE LOSS IN PORTFOLIO IS DUE TO MARKET FLUCTUATION.  COMPLAINT CLOSED.  THE COMPLAINT WAS ORIGINALLY FILED AS A FIRM COMPLAINT WITH A POOR PERFORMANCE PROBLEM CODE.  AFTER A JANUARY 2007 STATE EXAMINATION FROM THE STATE OF WA., THE EXAMINERS SUGGESTED THE COMPLAINT CODING BE CHANGED TO REFLECT A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE IR VS. FIRM.  THE CODING WAS CHANGED WHICH TRIGGERED THE NEED TO FILE GIVEN THE ALLEGED LOSSES.""
