  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 21061, MAY 28, 2009: SECTION 17(A) OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND SECTION 10(B) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND RULE 10B-5 THEREUNDER - THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION CHARGED TEN BROKERS WITH FRAUD RELATED TO MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES KNOWN AS COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (\""CMOS\""). THE TEN BROKERS HAD ALL WORKED FOR A NOW DEFUNCT BROKER-DEALER. THE BROKERS ALLEGEDLY REPRESENTED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THE SECURITIES WERE SAFE AND SUITABLE FOR RETIREES AND CONSERVATIVE INVESTORS, WHEN IN FACT THEY WERE NOT. THE COMMISSION ALLEGES THAT WILLIAM BETTA, JR., AND OTHERS DEFRAUDED OVER 750 CUSTOMERS BY SELLING THEM RISKY TYPES OF CMOS BETWEEN 2004 AND 2007. ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION'S COMPLAINT, THE DEFENDANTS TOLD THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THE CMOS IN WHICH THEY WOULD INVEST WERE SAFE, SECURE, LIQUID INVESTMENTS THAT WERE SUITABLE FOR RETIREES AND INVESTORS WITH CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENT GOALS. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT CONTRARY TO THESE REPRESENTATIONS, THE DEFENDANTS INVESTED IN RISKY TYPES OF CMOS THAT: (1) WERE NOT ALL GUARANTEED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT; (2) JEOPARDIZED CUSTOMERS' YIELD AND PRINCIPAL; (3) WERE LARGELY ILLIQUID; AND (4) WERE ONLY SUITABLE FOR SOPHISTICATED INVESTORS WITH A HIGH-RISK INVESTMENT PROFILE. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS RECEIVED $18 MILLION IN COMMISSIONS AND SALARIES RELATED TO CMO INVESTMENTS. THE COMPLAINT ALSO ALLEGES THAT SOME DEFENDANTS TOLD CUSTOMERS THAT THEY WOULD USE MARGIN, OR THE ABILITY TO BORROW MONEY TO PURCHASE CMOS, ONLY SPARINGLY, WHEN IN FACT THEY HEAVILY MARGINED CUSTOMERS' ACCOUNTS, RESULTING IN LOSSES OF OVER $36 MILLION."",
