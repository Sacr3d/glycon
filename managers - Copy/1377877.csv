  ""Broker Comment"" : ""\""CLIENT ALLEGES MANAGED ACCOUNT INVESTMENT WAS LIQUIDATED WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION.  ACTIVITY DATES 5/31/2016-5/31/2016\"" AS I UNDERSTAND IT, ON FEBRUARY 28, 2017 - APPROXIMATELY EIGHT MONTHS AFTER I LEFT JP MORGAN SECURITIES, LLC (\""FIRM\"") AND WHILE THE CLIENT WAS UNDER THE CARE OF OTHER FINANCIAL ADVISORS, THE CLIENT ALLEGED THAT ON MAY 31, 2016, I, WHILE HER FINANCIAL ADVISOR, LIQUIDATED HER MANAGED ACCOUNT, WHICH INVOLVES CLOSING OUT HER POSITIONS AND PLACING THE ACCOUNT IN CASH.  FURTHERMORE, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, SHE CLAIMS SHE DID NOT AUTHORIZE THIS ACTION. THIS ALLEGATION IS BOTH FACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND IT IS FALSE. THE ALLEGATION IS FACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE FIRM'S SOFTWARE PROTOCOLS GOVERNING MANAGED ACCOUNTS PROHIBIT FINANCIAL ADVISORS FROM CONDUCTING THE TRADES REQUIRED TO LIQUIDATE A MANAGED ACCOUNT; ONLY THE FIRM'S MANAGED ACCOUNT OPERATIONS GROUP IS ABLE TO CONDUCT TRADES AND LIQUIDATE ACCOUNTS. THE MANAGED ACCOUNT OPERATIONS GROUP WILL NOT ACT TO LIQUIDATE A MANAGED ACCOUNT UNTIL THEY HAVE WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION FROM THE CUSTOMER IN THE FORM OF A SIGNED MANAGED ACCOUNT TERMINATION FORM.  THIS ALLEGATION IS FALSE BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER DID, IN FACT, SIGN THE FIRM'S MANAGED ACCOUNT TERMINATION FORM, WHICH AUTHORIZED THE FIRM'S MANAGED ACCOUNT OPERATIONS GROUP TO LIQUIDATE HER MANAGED ACCOUNT.  THE FIRM HAS THIS EXECUTED DOCUMENT IN ITS FILES.  IN CONCLUSION, THE CLIENT AUTHORIZED THE LIQUIDATION AND THE FIRM HAS THAT DOCUMENTATION""
