  ""Broker Comment"" : ""WARRANT WAS RECALLED MARCH 2002, CHARGES WERE DISMISSED BY MOTION OF THE PEOPLE. REP'S STATEMENT: ON MY LAST DAY OF COLLEGE BEFORE GRADUATION AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY I WAS STUDYING FOR MY FINAL REMAINING EXAM WITH OTHER SUTDENTS FROM MY CLASS.  WHILE WALKING WITH THESE CLASSMATES TO ANOTHER SECTION OF THE LIBRARY IN THE SAME BUILDING, THERE WERE SENSOR MACHINES INSTALLED.  I DID NOT SEE THESE MACHINES AND DID NOT REALIZE THAT STUDENTS COULD NOT TAKE BOOKS FROM ONE SECTION OF THE LIBRARY TO ANOTHER.  THESE SENSOR MACHINES WERE INSTALLED WITHIN THE ENTIRE LIBRARY BUILDING, CONNECTING DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE LIBRARY.   THE SENSOR MACHINE WE WALKED THROUGH SOUNDED AS I WAS CARRYING A SMALL $5.00 TO $10.00 BOOK FROM THE EAST SECTION OF THE LIBRARY TO THE WEST SECTION.  THE LIBRARY SECURITY GUARD THEN WROTE ME A TICKET FOR TAKING THE BOOK FROM ONE SECTION OF THE LIBRARY TO THE OTHER SECTION.  THE STUDENTS THAT WERE WALKING WITH ME AT THE TIME WERE WITNESSES TO THE ENTIRE SITUATION.   ALTHOUGH MYSELF AND THE WITNESSES TO THE SITUATION DISAGREED WITH THE SECURITY GUARD, HE INSISTED THAT I MEANT TO ILLEGALLY TRANSPORT THE BOOK.  A COURT DATE WAS SET REGARDING THIS SITUATION.  I APPEARED IN COURT WITH A WITNESS OF THE SITUATION.  THE CHARGES WERE THEN DROPPED.  I AM CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE SAN DIEGO COURTS TO HAVE THIS EVENT EXPUNGED FROM MY RECORD.    ""
