  ""Allegations"" : ""WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, WALKER CONSENTED TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT HE AND TWO OTHER RESPONDENTS ENGAGED IN AN OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITY WITH A REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND DID NOT ADEQUATELY DISCLOSE THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR TO THEIR MEMBER FIRM. DESPITE THE FIRM'S AWARENESS OF THE RESPONDENTS' DESIRE TO OBTAIN AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR, THE FIRM WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE RESPONDENTS' ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THE ESTABLISHMENT, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR. WALKER AND THE OTHER RESPONDENTS FORMED AND REGISTERED THE REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISOR WITH THREE NOMINEE OWNERS ACTING IN THEIR STEAD AS MAJORITY MEMBERS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR, WHICH EACH NOMINEE ACQUIRING A 26.67 PERCENT OWNERSHIP STAKE IN THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR. THE NOMINEES AGREED TO TRANSFER THEIR OWNERSHIP INTERESTS TO RESPONDENTS IF AND WHEN THE FIRM PERMITTED RESPONDENTS TO OWN THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR. THE FIRM HAD REPEATEDLY DENIED RESPONDENTS' REQUESTS TO OWN AND OPERATE THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR. THE NOMINEES DID NOT PROVIDE ANY INVESTMENT OR ANY SERVICES IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR OWNERSHIP INTERESTS. THE NOMINEES NEVER PARTICIPATED IN THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR'S MANAGEMENT OR DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. WALKER PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY $170,000 TO FUND THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR'S BUSINESS. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT WALKER AND THE OTHER RESPONDENTS PARTICIPATED IN PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND DID NOT DISCLOSE THEIR PARTICIPATION TO THEIR FIRM. SPECIFICALLY, THE RESPONDENTS SOUGHT TO RECOUP SOME OF THEIR INVESTMENT IN THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND ARRANGED FOR A THIRD PARTY INVESTOR TO ACQUIRE AN INTEREST IN THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR. THE RESPONDENTS DIRECTED EACH NOMINEE OWNER TO GIVE 1.67 PERCENT OF THE OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR TO THE SPOUSE OF ONE RESPONDENT (SO THAT EACH OF THE THREE SPOUSES HELD 1.67 PERCENT). ON THE SAME DAY, THE SPOUSES' SHARES WERE SOLD TO THE INVESTOR FOR A TOTAL OF $225,000. ONCE MORE, THE RESPONDENTS STRUCTURED A SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT WITH ANOTHER INVESTOR WHO PAID APPROXIMATELY $180,000 FOR A 5 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR, AGAIN CONVEYED THROUGH THE RESPONDENTS' SPOUSES. THE NOMINEES DID NOT RECEIVE ANY COMPENSATION FOR THE INTERESTS THEY SURRENDERED. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT WALKER AND THE OTHER RESPONDENTS FAILED TO ACCURATELY COMPLETE ANNUAL COMPLIANCE QUESTIONNAIRES, BY CLAIMING NOT TO HAVE ANY UNDISCLOSED ACTIVITIES ON THEIR COMPLIANCE QUESTIONNAIRES, AND INACCURATELY DESCRIBED THOSE ACTIVITIES ON THEIR OUTSIDE ACTIVITY DISCLOSURE FORMS."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""EXCEPT FOR THE AWC AND AN EARLIER SEC CONSENT ORDER, MR. WALKER HAS NOT BEEN THE SUBJECT OF ANY OTHER DISCIPLINARY ACTION DURING HIS 30 YEAR CAREER IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY.  NEITHER THE AWC NOR THE SEC CONSENT ORDER, WHICH BOTH AROSE FROM THE SAME FACTS SURROUNDING THE ESTABLISHMENT AND OWNERSHIP OF AN INVESTMENT ADVISORY FIRM, SIGNALPOINT ASSET MANAGEMENT (\""SIGNALPOINT\""), CONTAIN ANY FINDING OF CUSTOMER LOSSES OR COMPLAINTS. MOREOVER, AS NOTED IN THE AWC, MR. WALKER'S FORMER SECURITIES BROKERAGE FIRM WAS, AT ALL TIMES, FULLY AWARE OF HIS INTEREST IN OWNING SIGNALPOINT.  SIGNALPOINT, CONTINUES TO OPERATE AS A SEC REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISER.  LIKEWISE, MR. WALKER REMAINS REGISTERED AS AN INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH ALL APPLICABLE FEDERAL/STATE AGENCIES.""

  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC ADMINISTRATIVE RELEASE 34-72515; IA RELEASE 40-3868, JULY 2, 2014: THE SEC DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 15(B) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND SECTIONS 203(E), 203(F) AND 203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 AGAINST A FIRM, ITS PRINCIPAL DENNIS R. WALKER, TWO OTHER PRINCIPALS, AND THE FIRM'S CCO. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE INSTITUTION OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, RESPONDENTS HAVE SUBMITTED OFFERS OF SETTLEMENT WHICH THE COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED TO ACCEPT. SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AND ANY OTHER PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION, OR TO WHICH THE COMMISSION IS A PARTY, AND WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS HEREIN, EXCEPT AS TO THE COMMISSION'S JURISDICTION OVER THEM AND THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, WHICH ARE ADMITTED, RESPONDENTS CONSENT TO THE ENTRY OF THIS ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS, PURSUANT TO SECTION 15(B) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND SECTIONS 203(E), 203(F) AND 203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER. THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT WHEN ADVISING THEIR ADVISORY CLIENTS TO INVEST WITH THE FIRM, THE PRINCIPALS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTY BY FAILING TO DISCLOSE ALL MATERIAL FACTS CONCERNING THE EXTENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO DIRECT THE FIRM'S MANAGEMENT AND POLICIES. THE PRINCIPALS ALSO BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTY BY FAILING TO DISCLOSE THEIR EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WHEN ADVISING CLIENTS TO INVEST WITH THE FIRM. IN PARTICULAR, THEY FAILED TO DISCLOSE TO CLIENTS THAT THEY HAD LOANED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO THE FIRM AND THEREFORE STOOD TO INDIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM CLIENTS' PAYMENT OF ADVISORY FEES TO THE FIRM. THE PRINCIPALS ALSO FAILED TO DISCLOSE THAT THEY WERE CONTINUING TO SEEK APPROVAL FROM THE DUALLY-REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISER THEY WERE EMPLOYED BY TO OBTAIN OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE FIRM, WHICH, IF OBTAINED, WOULD ENTITLE THEM TO SHARE IN ANY PROFITS THAT WERE DERIVED FROM CLIENTS' PAYMENTS OF ADVISORY FEES TO IT. AS A RESULT OF THE CONDUCT DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM, WALKER, AND THE OTHER PRINCIPALS WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 206(2) OF THE ADVISERS ACT. IN ADDITION, WALKER'S FIRM AND ITS CCO WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 207 OF THE ADVISERS ACT."",
