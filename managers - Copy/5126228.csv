  ""Allegations"" : ""NASD RULES 2110, 2711(G)(2): LANGSTON'S MEMBER FIRM PERMITTED HIM TO EXECUTE TRADES IN COVERED SECURITIES DURING A PERIOD BEGINNING 30 CALENDAR DAYS BEFORE AND ENDING FIVE CALENDAR DAYS AFTER PUBLISHING RESEARCH REPORTS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT COMPANIES. ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS DURING PROHIBITED TIME, HE EXECUTED TRADES INVOLVING A SUBJECT COMPANY AND THE CONCERNED COMPANY'S RESEARCH REPORTS WERE DRAFTED BY LANGSTON. THE TRANSACTIONS WERE GENERATED IN ACCOUNTS OWNED BY MEMBER OF HIS HOUSEHOLD, OR ACCOUNT OVER WHICH HE EXERCISED DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY."",

  ""Regulator Statement"" : ""WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, LANGSTON CONSENTED TO THE DESCRIBED SANCTION AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS; THEREFORE, HE IS FINED $5000.  FINE PAID 12/04/2008."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE ALLEGED VIOLATION OF NASD CONDUCT RULE 2711 (G) (2) WAS RELATED TO TWO OCCASIONS IN WHICH THE RESPONDENT PURCHASED SHARES OF A STOCK IN ACCOUNTS IN WHICH HE EXERCISED DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY WITHIN 30 DAYS PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF A RESEARCH REPORT.  AT THE TIME OF THE TRADES, THE RESPONDENT WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE RESEARCH REPORTS WOULD BE ISSUED IN THE FUTURE, AND THERE WAS NO SHORT-TERM SELL IN AN EFFORT TO PROFIT FROM A MOVE IN THE STOCK PRICE AS A RESULT OF THE LATER ISSUANCE OF THE RESEARCH REPORTS.  AS OF THE DATE OF THE AWC (10/10/08) ALL SHARES THAT RESULTED IN THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS WERE STILL OWNED BY THE CUSTOMERS IN WHOSE ACCOUNTS THE SHARES WERE PURCHASED AND THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS RESULTED IN A FINANCIAL BENEFIT TO THESE ACCOUNTS WAS LESS THAN $100.   IN ADDITION, DUE TO THE LIMITED DISTRIBUTION OF REPORTS, AND THE SMALL SIZE OF THE FIRM, FIRST DALLAS DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE FIRM'S PUBLISHED RESEARCH REPORTS HAVE EVER HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE STOCK PRICE OF A SUBJECT SECURITY.  BASED UPON THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE LACK OF ANY CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS, FIRST DALLAS BELIEVES NO THIRD PARTIES WERE HARMED BY THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS.  THESE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS WERE RESOLVED THROUGH A LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE, WAIVER, AND CONSENT (\""AWC\""), IN WHICH THE ISSUES WERE SETTLED WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING ANY FINDING IN THE AWC.""
