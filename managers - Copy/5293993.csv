  ""Broker Comment"" : ""FRESHMAN YEAR IN COLLEGE. I WAS DRIVING BACK TO MY DORM ROOM WITH MY ROOMMATE. WE GOT PULLED OVER BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA POLICE FOR A BROKEN TAILLIGHT. THE OFFICER ASKED FOR MY DRIVER LICENSE. HE SAW A BOTTLE OF LIQUOR IN THE BACK SEAT. HE THEN LOOKED AT MY DRIVER LICENSE AND REALIZED I WASN'T OLD ENOUGH TO PURCHASE THE ALCOHOL. SO I TURNED THE FALSE IDENTIFICATION OVER THAT I USED TO PURCHASE THE ALCOHOL.""
