  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CLIENT IS A VERY EDUCATED INDIVIDUAL WITH AN MBA IN FINANCE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.  HE HAS SPENT 25+ YEARS DEVELOPING MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR REAL ESTATE DEALS, FUNDED WITH VERY SOPHISTICATED FINANCING.  HIS CLAIM WAS THAT HE WAS UNAWARE THAT HIS NEW INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD LOSE VALUE.  BASED ON MY INTERACTIONS WITH THE CLIENT, I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THE CLIENT WAS MOTIVATED BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW COMPLAINTS ARE HANDLED BY INVESTMENT FIRMS.  THE CLIENT HAD TAKEN SEVERAL DAYS TO REVIEW AND COMPLETE THE REQUIRED NEW INVESTMENT ACCOUNT DOCUMENTS.  IN THE END, HE STATED THAT HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS OPENING AN INVESTMENT ACCOUNT.  THIS IS NOT A CONSISTENT CLAIM FROM A CLIENT WITH HIS LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION IN FINANCE.""
