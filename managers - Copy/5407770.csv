  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Regarding the investment product:  We discussed the risks and objectives orally, the client knew he was investing in the market and there would be potential for loss.  In addition to discussing this it was documented in the paperwork for the account.  The client reviewed and signed the paperwork and all was in good order regarding the client's account.  The risk and objectives were specified verbally with the client and also documented in the paperwork.     Regarding poor service: I informed the client that I would be out of the office for the birth of my child and gave him the client service line for any order instructions he might need to execute.   My work phone number also had the 800 number for client services and stated that order instructions were not to be left over the phone voicemail and they could not be executed via voice messages.  We had a phone conversation before I was out of office and I verbally gave him the dates that I would be out and informed him that if needed he could call the 800 number for assistance.  Union Bank has  reviewed this complaint and it has been denied.""
