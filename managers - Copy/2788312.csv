  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN EARLY 2006 I WAS INTRODUCED TO SEVERAL REAL ESTATE OPPORTUNITIES BY A WELL-KNOWN REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER. I HAD DONE EXTENSIVE DUE DILIGENCE ON THESE OPPORTUNITIES. I HAD RECEIVED ASSURANCES FROM THE DEVELOPER THAT THE INVESTMENTS WERE SAFE & THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO SELL THE PROPERTY WITHIN 6 TO 18 MONTHS FOR A MEANINGFUL PROFIT. THE BANK AND THE BANK'S APPRAISAL SUPPORTED THE INCREASED VALUE. BASED UPON THIS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, I PURCHASED 2 LOTS. IT TURNED OUT THAT THE OWNER AND THEIR AFFILIATES PERPETRATED A WIDE SCALE MORTGAGE FRAUD. MANY HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED AND HAD THEIR LICENSES TERMINATED, GONE INTO BANKRUPTCY, FOUND GUILTY OF CRIMINAL CHARGES AND/OR SENT TO JAIL FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN THIS SCHEME. I JOINED A MASS-TORT LAWSUIT TO ASSERT MY RIGHTS AND PROTECT MY FAMILY (CASE NO. 10-CV-28-H); UNFORTUNATELY, THE CASE IS MOCING VERY SLOWLY. BANKRUPTCY WAS MY ONLY OPTION NOW. DISCHARGED.""
