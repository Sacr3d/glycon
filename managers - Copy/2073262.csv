  ""Allegations"" : ""On July 01, 2019, OCI sent notice via first-class and certified mail to Mr. Watters that his Wisconsin insurance license would be revoked in 31 days if he did not make certified payment arrangements with DOR before that date. OCI did not receive notice that a clearance certificate was issued by DOR to Mr. Watters until August 14, 2019, after the insurance license had already been revoked on August 01, 2019. Mr. Watters did not request a hearing to contest the administrative action, nor has he reapplied for Wisconsin insurance licensure."",
