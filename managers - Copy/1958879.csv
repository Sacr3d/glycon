The Commission finds that on January 9, 2020, Pagartanis pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud in violation of Title 18 United States Code, Sections 1341, 1343, and 1349 before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, in United States v. Steven Pagartanis, Crim. No. 18-cr-374 (E.D.N.Y.). On January 14, 2020, a judgment in the criminal case was entered against Pagartanis. He was sentenced to a prison term of 170 months followed by 3 years of supervised release and ordered to make restitution in the amount of $6,519,594. The count of the criminal indictment to which Pagartanis pled guilty alleged, inter alia, that, between January 2000 and March 2018, Pagartanis knowingly and intentionally conspired to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud at least 17 individuals who collectively invested more than $13 million with him, and that he caused commercial interstate carriers to deliver investors' deposits to him. In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted to determine whether the allegations set forth hereof are true and, in connection therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations; and what, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act."",

  ""Allegations"" : ""Litigation Release No. No. 24152 / May 30, 2018 / - The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York: - The Securities and Exchange Commission charged a former registered representative, Steven Pagartanis, with defrauding long-standing brokerage customers in an $8 million investment scam. Pagartanis, a former registered representative who was associated with various Commission-registered firms, defrauded at least nine retail investors of approximately $8 million by soliciting and selling them securities using false and misleading statements from 2013 to at least February 2018 (the \""Relevant Period\""). Contrary to his promises that he would make safe investments that would yield monthly return payments, Pagartanis never made any investments. Instead, Pagartanis deposited the investor funds into various bank accounts that he controlled and then used the funds, among other things, for his personal benefit and to make monthly return payments to investors in a Ponzi scheme-like manner. Despite complaints from investors and queries from regulators, Pagartanis has stopped making monthly payments and has not returned investors' funds. Pagartanis told at least five of the investors that they were investing in the common stock of Genesis Land Development Co. (\""GDC\""), a Canadian land development and home building company whose stock is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Pagartanis raised at least $6.7 million from these investors. Pagartanis told other investors that he was investing their money in a land development company. At Pagartanis' direction, investors paid for their investments with checks made payable to \""Genesis,\"" the name of the LLC for which Pagartanis is the sole owner and also the same name as GDC, the Canadian land development company. Pagartanis deposited the investors' checks into Genesis I's bank account, over which he had sole control. Pagartanis never invested any of the money he raised from the investors in the common stock of, or anything related to, GDC. Pagartanis knew, or recklessly disregarded, that his statements regarding how the investor funds would be invested and the safety of the investors' funds were false. To further his charade, he deceptively provided some of these investors with fictitious account statements indicating that they owned GDC stock and GDC's financial statements. As a result of Pagartanis false and misleading statements, at least nine investors invested at least $8 million with Pagartanis. Pagartanis failed to appear for an interview in March 2018 with his member firm's compliance staff, which had received an investor complaint and contacted Pagartanis in an effort to speak with him. Pagartanis then failed to respond to a request for an interview with FINRA in March 2018. FINRA barred Pagartanis from associating with any FINRA member in April 2018. By virtue of the conduct alleged in the complaint, Defendant engaged in acts, practices and courses of business, that constitute violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder."",
