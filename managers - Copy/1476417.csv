THE NASD PANEL ALSO RECOMMENDED THE EXPUNGEMENT OF THE MATTER FROM THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR'S CRD.  THE CASE WAS REMANDED FOR A NEW HEARING BECAUSE ONE ARBITRATROR HELD A SMALL, UNDISCLOSED INTEREST IN PIPER STOCK, AND WAS SETTLED THEREAFTER, WITHOUT ANY ADMISSION OF LIABILITY, TO AVOID THE TIME, EXPENSE AND INCONVENIENCE OF A RE-TRIAL.  THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SETTLEMENT.""
