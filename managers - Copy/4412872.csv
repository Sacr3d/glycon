  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In July of 2019 I resigned my position and tried to start a planning practice with Thrivent. I became depressed in Oct. and sought out professional help. I did attend a 10 week intense outpatient therapy treatment program in while living with my sister. It took me 4 months to get back on my feet. I lived off of my retirement funds and now need to pay taxes and penalty on those funds. I needed to file bankruptcy to even come close to staying afloat.""
