  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON 8/28/85, I WAS DRIVING MY MOTORCYCLE AT AN EXCESSIVE RATE OF SPEED.  I WAS UNAWARE THAT A POLICE VEHICLE WAS PURSUING ME.  WHEN I REALIZED I WAS BEING PURSUED, I PULLED OVER AND WAS ARRESTED BY THE POLICE OFFICERS.  I PLED GUILTY TO THE CHARGE OF \""ATTEMPT TO ELUDE POLICE VEHICLE,\"" AT THE INSTRUCTION OF MY ATTORNEY.  I LATER REQUESTED THAT THE JUDGE REVOKE THE CONVICTION.  BECAUSE I HAD COMPLETED COMMUNITY SERVICE, PAID THE FINES AND COURT COSTS, THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER VACATING THE CONVICTION ON 11/12/97.""
