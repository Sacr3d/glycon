ALL THREE  CHOICED UTILIZED SOME FORM OF RISK MANAGEMENT TO ATTEMPT TO PROTECT HER FUNDS IN THE EVENT OF A DECLINING MARKET. SHE REVIEWED, SIGNED AND ACCEPTED THE PLAN AND SELECTED THE AMERICAN SKANDIA ASL ANNUITY USING RTE ASSET MANAGEMENT. THIS ANNUITY HAS NO SURRENDER CHARGES AND PAID HER A BONUS OF 1% TO START.

I RECOMMENDED THAT SHE REPLACE THE THIRD PARTY MANAGER, RTE, WITH PORTFOLIO STRATEGIES INC ON NOVEMBER 2001. WE WERE THEN CONTACTED BY AN ANN HIROSHIGE WHO SAID SHE HAD FINANCIAL  POWER OF ATTORNEY ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMER AND SAID THAT HER ACCOUNT HAD GONE DOWN AND THAT SHE WAS GOING TO MOVE IT ELSEWHERE. WE WERE CONTACTED ON JANUARY 2002 BY THE BACK OFFICE AT LINSCO PRIVATE LEDGER TO HAVE THE ACCOUNT MOVED TO THEIR BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. I ADDRESSED A LETTER TO CUSTOMER RECOMMENDING THE FUNDS NOT BE TRANSFERRED OUT OF AMERICAN SKANDIA IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE VALUABLE DEATH BENEFIT THAT WAS ATTACHED, WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE UP FOR ANY LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF CUSTOMER'S DEATH WHERE ANN HIROSHIGE WAS BENEFICIARY OF ACCOUNT.
