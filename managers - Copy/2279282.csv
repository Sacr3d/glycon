BEGAN OPERATING AS AN INVESTMENT ADVISOR, PROVIDING ADVICE TO CLIENTS AND COLLECTING FEES FOR ONE QUARTER.   HOWEVER, THE COMPANY SHOULD HAVE BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE STATE OF OREGON RATHER THAN THE SEC, AS THEY HAD LESS THAN $25MILLION IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT.  WHEN OREGON DETERMINED THAT THEY WERE OPERATING WITHOUT THE CORRECT LISCENCE, A CEASE AND DESIST WAS ORDERED UNTIL THE PROPER REGISTRATION WAS FILED AND IN PLACE.  UPON COMPLETION OF THE STATE REGISTRATION, AND PAYMENT OF THE FINE, BIRCH AND MONTEITH WERE IMMEDIATELY ALLOWED TO BEGIN PRACTICING BUSINESS AS INVESTMENT ADVISERS.""
