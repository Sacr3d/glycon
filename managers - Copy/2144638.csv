  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS CUSTOMER COMPLAINT WAS BASED IN LARGE PART ON HIS PHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH ING. THE CUSTOMER LISTS THE DATES AND NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS HE SPOKE WITH AT ING CONFIRMING THE 7% PART OF THE RIDER ON HIS VARIABLE ANNUITY. HE DID NOT COME INTO MY OFFICE FOR A REVIEW OF HIS ING VA, IN WHICH CASE I WOULD HAVE GONE OVER THE RIDER AND REITERATED THE PART OF THE RIDER THAT WAS STILL IN EFFECT. I WAS NOT NAMED IN THE COMPLAINT AND MARKETING MATERIALS IN THE CUSTOMER'S POSSESSION SHOWED MY EMPHASIS ON THE PARTS OF THE RIDER THAT WOULD CONTINUE UNTIL AGE 90. THE FEES PAID FOR THIS RIDER (ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOMER'S COMPUTATIONS) ARE $1,452.68. HALF OF THE RIDER WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL AGE 90. HIS GUARANTEED INCOME RIDER COULD ACTUALLY ATTAIN HIS GOALS WITH THE QUARTERLY RATCHET PORTION OF THE RIDER. IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THIS MATTER SHOULD NOT HAVE RISEN TO A REPORTABLE EVENT. THE COMPLAINT WAS DENIED BY ING.""
