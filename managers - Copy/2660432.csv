  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Hammond consented to the sanction and to the entry of findings that he participated in private securities transactions totaling $1,638,000 without providing written notice to his member firm. The findings stated that the transactions involved investments in limited liability companies controlled by Hammond's half-brother. Hammond participated in these transactions by referring investors to his half-brother, attending meetings about the investments and receiving compensation for his referrals. Two of the limited liability company investments turned out to be Ponzi schemes.  Hammond referred customers, who invested a total of $1,019,000, to these fraudulent investments. Additionally, in a firm compliance questionnaire, Hammond falsely answered questions about whether he participated in private securities transactions or received referral fees outside of his firm."",
