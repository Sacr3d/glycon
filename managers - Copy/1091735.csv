  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I DENY THESE ALLEGATIONS.  CUSTOMER LOOKED AT A FIXED BUCKET IN HIS VA AND CHOSE INSTEAD A DCA BONUS INTO THE MONEY MARKET. IT IS MY OPINION THAT HE UNDERSTOOD HE COULD MOVE TO FIXED ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME.  I FEEL THE ISSUE IS THAT HE WOULD LOSE HIS DCA BONUS IF HE CHOSE THE FIXED ACCOUNT. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAS SINCE CASHED IN AND BOUGHT A HIGH BONUS ANNUITY WHICH WOULD OFFSET HIS SURRENDER FEES ENTIRELY. *** 6/9/04 - CLIENT'S INITIAL COMPLAINT, WHICH WAS NON-FILEABLE, WAS DENIED. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE CLIENT HAS INDICATED THE FUNDS INVESTED IN THE ANNUITIES WERE TO BE PLACED IN FIXED SUB-ACCOUNTS. SINCE THE ANNUITIES WERE PURCHASED, THE CLIENT HAS RECEIVED STATEMENTS (FROM EDWARD JONES AS WELL AS THE ANNUITY COMPANY) WHICH PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING THE ANNUITIES TO INCLUDE SUB-ACCOUNT ALLOCATIONS AND VALUE(S). IN REVIEWING STATEMENTS, IT APPEARS THE FUNDS WERE INITIALLY ALLOCATED TO THE DCA PLUS 12 SUB-ACCOUNT. THIS SUB-ACCOUNT GENERALLY ENABLES A CLIENT TO MOVE FUNDS TO OTHER AVAILABLE SUB-ACCOUNTS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. THE FUNDS CONTINUING TO BE HELD IN THE DCA SUB-ACCOUNT EARNED A FIXED RATE WHILE THE PORTION OF FUNDS MOVED TO OTHER SUB-ACCOUNTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO MARKET FLUCTUATION. ACCORDING TO STATEMENT INFORMATION, FUNDS WITHIN THE ANNUITIES WERE MOVED FROM THE DCA SUB-ACCOUNT TO THE MONEY MARKET SUB-ACCOUNT AND WERE SUBSEQUENTLY MOVED TO A FIXED SUB-ACCOUNT. BASED ON OUR REVIEW, NO NEW INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED WHICH WARRANTS A CHANGE IN THE FIRM'S POSITION REGARDING THIS MATTER. CLAIM DENIED.   ""
