  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CLIENT WANTED TO TRANSFER HIS IRA ACCOUNT TO E*TRADE WHERE HE ALREADY HAD ANOTHER ACCOUNT.  I SENT HIM AN EMAIL WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE AN ACCOUNT TRANSFER. IN THE EMAIL I ASKED THAT HE FILL OUT ACCOUNT TRANSFER FORM AND ATTACH HIS MOST RECENT STATEMENT. CLIENT SENT BACK SIGNED ACCOUNT TRANSFER FORM ALONG WITH STATEMENT. I COMPLETED THE MISSING SECTIONS OF THE TRANSFER FORM FOR THE CLIENT CHOOSING \""FULL TRANSFER\"" BASED ON OUR CONVERSATION THAT HE WANTED TO TRANSFER HIS ENTIRE ACCOUNT TO E*TRADE.  AFTER THE TRANSFER WAS COMPLETED THE CLIENT INDICATED HE THOUGHT HIS MUTUAL FUND WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLD AT HIS PRIOR FIRM.  SELLING THE FUND IS NOT AN OPTION WITH THIS TYPE OF TRANSFER, AND THE CLIENT HAD NOT COMMUNICATED THAT INTENT DURING OUR PRIOR CONVERSATIONS. *******MATTER IS NO LONGER REPORTABLE*******""
