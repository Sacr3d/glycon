  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This consumer-initiated complaint resulted in a $5,000.00 restitution for the consumer, not $10,000.00 as previously denoted.  Therefore, it does not meet the criteria as set forth in disclosure question 14I(2)(1). Complaint was initiated by competing broker who wished to have money transferred to his company without penalty.  The insurance company rejected his complaint request, explaining that the client could do a spousal continuation or request a 5 year payout without penalty.  Instead of advising her to take one of these 2 options, he advised her to proceed with the surrender, pay the penalty, and then transfer to his company.  He then helped her file the complaint to the state.""
