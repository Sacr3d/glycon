  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON 01/06/2000 I RECEIVED THIS DESIST AND REFRAIN FROM SELLING 9MO. PROMISSORY NOTES FROM CORLOGIC. I HAD ALREADY LEFT THE COMPANY THAT WAS SELLING THIS PRODUCT. I WAS EMPLOYED BY CAL.SR. CIT. FOUND.FROM MARCH 1999 TO DEC. 1999. THEY HAD MISINFORMED THEIR REPS, THEIR OWN ATTORNEYS WERE PUSHING THE 9 MO. NOTE AS GUARANTEED AND NO LICENSING NEEDED. I NOW KNOW DIFFERENTLY.I HAD NEVER SOLD A SECURITY AND WAS NOT WITH A B/D TO TELL ME OTHERWISE. UNTIL NOW I ASSUMED THIS WAS SIMPLY A NOTICE TO CAL. SR. CITIZENS. IF I HAD KNOWN THIS WAS AN ACTION AGAINST ME I WOULD HAVE SO INDICATED BEFORE NOW. PLEASE ACCEPT MY SINCEREST APOLOGY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. I HAD U-5'D FROM RUSSIAN RIVER TO SUMMIT WITH NO PROBLEM SO THAT HAD CONFIRMED TO ME THAT THIS WAS SIMPLY AN ACTION ON CALIFORNIA SENIOR CITIZENS, NOT ME.""
