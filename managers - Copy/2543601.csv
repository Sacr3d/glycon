  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I have an IRS lien for back taxes from 2007 - 2012. As of my last statement from the IRS, this balance stands at $20,718.96. I am currently working with a CPA to get the remainder of this balance cleared up as soon as possible.  In November 2012, with the sale of my home, I made a $16,000+ payment to the IRS for part of these back taxes (plus penalties and interest) and am working with them to clear up the remaining balance (most of which is from penalties). This happened because of incorrectly reported income in 2007, from distributions I took from a retirement plan (to fund a business), 1099-consultant income in 2011 and a significant drop in my overall income beginning in 2008.""
