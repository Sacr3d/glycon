As of the date of the complaint filing, [Customers] were clients of the Solvay Bank Trust Dept.  Clients never established a brokerage account with Mr. Jacob.  In addition, the alleged unsuitable trade was placed and executed prior to Mr. Jacob's being an employee of the bank.  The Bank Trust Officer who was responsible for the trade was no longer an employee as of the date of the settlement.   Mr Jacob had zero responsibility or compensatory liability to the settlement paid.  All settlement was paid by Solvay Bank.""
