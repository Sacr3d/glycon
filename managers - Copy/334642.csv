  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CUSTOMER COMPLAINT FILED AGAINST MR. MILLER ON APRIL 30, 1987, BY CUSTOMER. HE FILED A STATEMENT OF CLAIM WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS. CUSTOMER SOUGHT TO RECOVER $29,028.36 IN ACTUAL DAMAGES PLUS INTEREST AND ATTORNEY'S FEES ON THE BASIS OF HIS ALLEGATION OF UNSUITABLE TRADING IN INDEX OPTIONS. CUSTOMER, A RETIRED GENTLEMAN IN HIS 70'S, ASSERTED THAT INDEX OPTIONS HAD BEEN MISREPRESENTED AS SAFE. MR. MILLER WAS RECOMMENDING WRITING COMBINATIONS OF OEX OPTIONS, BRACKETING THE INDEX WITHIN 10 POINTS WITH RESPECT TO THE STRIKE PRICE.  ALTHOUGH CUSTOMER WAS FINANCIALLY SUITABLE, AND HAD SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE IN THE STOCK MARKET AND SOME OPTIONS EXPERIENCE AS WELL, HE LACKED PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN SHORT OPTIONS TRADING. IN ORDER TO AVOID THE COST OF LITIGATING THE MATTER FURTHER, MERRILL LYNCH SETTLED THE MATTER FOR $14,500 ON JUNE 21, 1988. MR. MILLER WAS NOT ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SETTLEMENT BY MERRILL LYNCH.""
