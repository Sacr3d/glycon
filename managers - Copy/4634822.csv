  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON 5-20-14, I WENT TO THE CAFETERIA AND PURCHASED MY LUNCH.  ON THE WAY BACK TO MY DESK A CO-WORKER AND I LITERALLY RAN INTO EACH OTHER SPILLING MY LUNCH TO THE FLOOR.  I CLEANED IT UP AND WENT BACK TO THE CAFETERIA TO BUY MY LUNCH AGAIN.  THE COOK GAVE ME A HARD TIME ABOUT EATING TWO LUNCHES SO I TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED.  THE COOK RESPONDED DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, I GOT IT, IT'S ON ME.  HE HANDED ME MY LUNCH AND I LEFT THE CAFETERIA.  I KNEW I WAS LATE SO I LEFT THE CAFETERIA QUICKLY AND WENT BACK TO WORK. I DID NOT GO TO THE CASHIER AND DID NOT QUESTION HIS ACTIONS.  TWO DAYS LATER I WAS CALLED TO A MEETING WITH HR AND WAS ACCUSED OF STEALING MY LUNCH.  I WAS STUNNED AND CONFUSED AS TO WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT.  I PURCHASED MY LUNCH ON MY CREDIT CARD AND COULD SHOW I PAID FOR MY LUNCH THE FIRST TIME.  HOWEVER BECAUSE I DID NOT GO TO THE CASHIER (THE COOK DID NOT TELL ME I NEEDED TO) THE VIDEO SHOWS ME LEAVING SO THE DECISION WAS MADE TO TERMINATE MY EMPLOYMENT IMMEDIATELY BASED ON THE FOOTAGE.  NO REVIEW OF MY FIRST TRIP TO THE CAFETERIA WAS DONE AND I WAS NOT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE COOK CORROBORATE WHAT HAPPENED.  HR STOOD BY THE REVIEW OF THE VIDEO(SECOND TRIP TO THE CAFETERIA) AND WAS ACCUSED OF THEFT/UNAUTHORIZED DISCOUNT EQUAL TO THEFT AND I WAS DISCHARGED.""
