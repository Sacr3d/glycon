  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I DELAYED FILING MY 2006 FEDERAL INCOME TAX. WHEN THE IRS CALCULATED MY TAX LIABILITY FOR THE YEAR, I DISPUTED THE INCOME, AND HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME WORKED ON FILING AN AMENDED RETURN TO REFLECT THE CORRECT AMOUNT. CURRENTLY ALL INFORMATION IS WITH MY CPA, I BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE CORRECT FIGURES ARE SUBMITTED THAT THE AMOUNTS PAID WILL COVER ANY TAX LIABILITY, BUT EH INTEREST AND PENALTIES STILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. I HAVE NOT SEEN A JUDGMENT, ONLY THE NOTICE OF INTENT TO LEVY.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""FACTS: ALLEGATIONS WERE SUBMITTED BY AN OPPOSING PARTY IN AN ESTATE MATTER. THE COMPLAINT WAS FROM A POTENTIAL HEIR WHO WANTED MORE OF THE ESTATE AND HAD ALREADY TAKEN POSSESSION OF ESTATE PROPERTY WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF THE ADMINISTRATOR OR THE COURT. THE OREGON BAR MADE ITS DETERMINATIONS BEFORE THE COURT CASE WAS CONCLUDED. THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT AND HAS NOT DETERMINED THAT THE FEES PAID TO ME BY THE ESTATE TO FILE, TO INVENTORY, TO NOTIFY CREDITORS AND SEARCH FOR THE WILL, WHICH THE PERSON MAKING THE COMPLAINT HAD REMOVED, WERE ILLEGAL. THE FEES PAID TO ME WERE 1/8TH THE AMOUNT THAT HAVE B EEN CHARGED SINCE THE PERSON COMPLAINING HAS BEEN APPOINTED ADMINISTRATOR. NEGLECTING: THE BAR ALSO MADE THIS FINDING ON ONE SIDE OF THE STORY, THE ADMINISTRATOR I REPRESENTED WAS SEARCHING FOR A NEW WILL THAT EVERYONE HAD BEEN MADE AWARE OF, BEFORE TAKING STEPS TO GO FORWARD WITH THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE ESTATE. THE PERSON COMPLAINING HAD REMOVED ALL DOCUMENTS PERTAINING TO THE ESTATE FROM THE RESIDENCE PRIOR TO FILING THE ESTATE WHICH CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DELAY AND CONCERN AS TO THE NEW WILL (THE NEW WILL WAS NEVER LOCATED, AND THE ADMINISTRATOR CHOSE NOT TO PURSUE CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST A FAMILY MEMBER AND MAKE THE ESTATE EVEN MORE CONFRONTATIONAL. THE PERSON MAKING THE COMPLAINT IS NO THE ADMINISTRATOR, HAS RUN UP MUCH LARGER ATTORNEY FEES, AND HAS NOT RESOLVED A SINGLE ISSUE THAT WAS PENDING IN THE ESTATE SINCE 2007. THE ALLEGATION AGAINST ME WAS FOR OVER A YEAR, IT HAS NOW BEEN 4 MORE YEARS. POSSIBLY IT IS TIME CONSUMING TO RESOLVE THIS ESTATE?  FAILURE TO WITHDRAW: I HAD WITHDRAWN AS THE ATTORNEY FOR OVER A YEAR WHEN THE BAR MADE ITS ALLEGATION, AND ENTERED THE 1 YEAR SUSPENSION. I HAD CONCLUDED MY PRACTICE FOR OVER A YEAR, AND HAD BEEN WORKING IN A DIFFERENT FIELD COMPLETELY. BEFORE I WITHDREW, I HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY CLIENT TO BE REPRESENTED BY AN OTHER ATTORNEY. I HAD A DISPUTE PENDING WITH THE BAR OVER REFUNDING FEES TO ME SINCE I HAD QUIT THE PRACTICE OF LAW. THE SOLUTION I CHOSE TO NOT OWE THE BAR MORE FEES, WAS TO QUIT COMMUNICATING WITH THEM AND GET SUSPENDED, OTHERWISE THEY KEPT INCREASING MY BILLS AFTER TELLING ME THAT I DID NOT OWE ANYTHING AND WAS INACTIVE.  I HAD BEEN WORKING ON A NEGOTIATION WITH TEH BAR OVER THE COMPLAINT, THAT WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM A 1 YEAR SUSPENSION, BUT WHEN I TOLD THEM I WAS TIRED OF THE CONTINUAL RUN AROUND OVER ENDING MY PRACTICE, THEY THEN WHEN ALL OUT ON THE FINDINGS AND LENGTH OF SUSPENSION.  I HAVE RECEIVED NOTICE THAT I AM ELIGIBLE TO REAPPLY, BUT I HAVE NO INTENTION OF GOING BACK TO LAW.""
