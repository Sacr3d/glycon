  ""Broker Comment"" : ""DEAN WITTER SETTLED OUT OF COURT FOR $16,000. [CUSTOMER] COMPLAINED ABOUT THE HANDLING OF HER ACCOUNT BY SUCCESSIVE ACCOUNT EXECUTIVES. ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE STEVEN BEATTY PURCHASE A GNMA UNIT TRUST WITH [CUSTOMRE'S] AUTHORIZATION, AND REINVESTED THE ACCUMULATED RETURNS OF PRINCIPLE IN THE UNIT TRUST AND IN A TAX-FREE MUTUAL FUND, AGAIN WITH [CUSTOMER'S] APPROVAL. ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE [OTHER FIRM EMPLOYEE] (WHO ASSUMED [CUSTOMER'S] ACCOUNT AFTER BEATTY LEFT THE FIRM) FOLLOWED [CUSTOMER'S] INSTRUCTION TO LIQUIDATE THE UNIT TRUST AND PURCHASE ONE MUTUAL FUND WITH THE PROCEEDS. LATER, AFTER DIRECTING THE LIQUIDATION OF THE ENTIRE ACCOUNT, [CUSTOMER] ALLEGED THAT THE INVESTMENTS IN HER ACCOUNT, WHICH OVER TIME CONSISTED SOLELY OF THE GNMA TRUST AND TWO MUTUAL FUNDS, WERE UNSUITABLE AND RESULTED IN LOSSES OF $24,980. ANY LOSSES IN THE ACCOUNT WERE DUE TO MARKET LOSSES AND SALES CHARGES, REALIZED SOLELY DUE TO [CUSTOMER'S] DIRECTION THAT THE INVESTMENTS SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED TO BE SOLD. THE FIRM (DEAN WITTER) DISPUTED THE VALIDITY OF [CUSTOMER'S] CLAIMS BUT SETTLED FOR $16,000 SOLELY TO AVOID THE LEGAL COSTS OF ENGAGING IN PRE-TRIAL DISCOVERY AND A JURY TRIAL IN THIS MATTER.""
