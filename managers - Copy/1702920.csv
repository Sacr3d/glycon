  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I am writing in response to Occurrence number 2061089 regarding a written complaint from [REDACTED].  [REDACTED] alleges that I did not fully disclose all the facts regarding life insurance as an investment/retirement policy.  I do not know [REDACTED] nor do I remember him from my employment with Prudential from August 1986 until March 2001.  I do not know what he is referring to nor do I remember or acknowledge any failure on my part to provide proper disclosure for any sale of insurance.  I am totally confident full disclosure of any policy or contract which I ever proposed, was explained with utmost professionalism, disclosure and explanation.  I made a firm practice of thoroughly completing suitability as required.  I hand delivered issued policies to the individual and reviewed the policy in detail with all my clients. I absolutely deny any accusation in [REDACTED] complaint. I have successfully worked and served in the financial services profession for more than thirty-four years without any blemish on my record or U-4.  I am disappointed that someone would wait almost twenty years or possibly longer to make such a claim.  Sincerely, Phillip M. Goodman""
