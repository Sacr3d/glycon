  ""Broker Comment"" : ""JUDGMENT ISSUED AS A RESULT OF LAWSUIT FILED BY MY FORMER DIVORCE ATTORNEY.  I EMPLOYED THE SERVICES OF [ATTORNEY] IN MAY 2007 FOR A PENDING DIVORCE.  IN AUGUST 2007, I TERMINATED THE ATTORNEY FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT.  ADDITIONAL FEES WERE BILLED TO ME FOR SERVICES WHICH WERE NEVER COMPLETED.  I DISPUTED THE FEES, AND THE ATTORNEY FILED SUIT AGAINST ME.  IN THE PROCESS OF THE DIVORCE I HAD MOVED TO TEXAS, AND COULD NOT AFFORD TO RETURN TO NEW JERSEY TO FIGHT THE LAWSUIT.  I REQUESTED AN ADJOURNMENT UNTIL THE WEEK OF MY DIVORCE HEARING SO THAT I MAY ATTEND BOTH, BUT THE COURT DENIED MY ADJOURNMENT REQUEST AND RULED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY.    UPDATE: 03/06/2015 - TO MY KNOWLEDGE, THE JUDGMENT HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED.  HOWEVER, IT NO LONGER APPEARS ON MY CREDIT REPORT.  IN ADDITION, I CALLED THE MERCER COUNTY MUNICIPAL COURT AND THEY COULD FIND NO RECORD OF MY CASE.  AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE, I WILL NOT PAY THIS JUDGMENT AS IT IS/WAS FRAUDULENT.  DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE JUDGMENT HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM MY CREDIT REPORT, AND IS NO LONGER PENDING WITH THE COURT, I WILL AWAIT NOTICE FROM THE COURT BEFORE ANY FURTHER ACTION IS TAKEN.""
