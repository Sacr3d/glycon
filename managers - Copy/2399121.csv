  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN 1979, I CLOSED MY CHECKING ACCOUNT AND MOVED. I DID NOT LEAVE A FORWARDING ADDRESS. I WAS UNAWARE THAT ONE CHECK HAD NOT CLEARED. THE STORE MANAGER WITH THE OUTSTANDING CHECK COULDN'T LOCATE ME AND PRESSED CHARGES. SEVERAL DAYS LATER I WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE POLICE WANTED ME. I WENT IN WAS TOLD OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARRESTED AND RELEASED. I WENT AND PICKED UP THE CHECK AND WENT TO COURT THE NEXT DAY. CHARGES WERE DISMISSED AND I HAD TO PAY COURT COSTS. I THOUGHT MY RECORDS WERE CLEAN.""
