  ""Broker Comment"" : ""On October 16, 2019, Highland Capital Management, L.P. (\""HCMLP\"") commenced voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the \""Court\""). HCMLP's filing stems from a potential judgment being sought against that entity. Although Highland disputes the underlying claims, entry of the judgment in its maximum potential amount could result in a judgment against HCMLP greater than the entity's liquid assets.  On January 9, 2020, the Court approved a change of control of Highland, which involved the resignation of James Dondero as an officer of HCMLP and of its general partner and as a director of its general partner and the appointment of three independent directors who have been granted exclusive control over Highland and its operations.  Mr. Dondero will, however, remain as an employee of Highland and as portfolio manager for all funds and vehicles for which he currently holds such titles, provided that all Mr. Dondero's responsibilities shall be in all cases as determined by the independent board and his role as an employee will be subject to the supervision, direction and authority of the independent board.""
