  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Hurtgen consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he solicited at least 14 individuals, 10 of whom were customers of his member firm, to invest in a private placement offering without providing prior written notice to the firm. The findings stated that three of the 14 individuals that Hurtgen solicited invested in that private offering, and Hurtgen participated in each of the transactions, which totaled $75,000. While the firm had approved Hurtgen's outside business activity with the company, it had not approved his subsequent private placement activities on behalf of it. The findings also stated that Hurtgen distributed sales materials for the private offering to investors that failed to comply with FINRA's content standards for communications with the public. The sales materials failed to provide a balanced presentation and a sound basis for evaluating the investment being promoted. The sales materials also contained forward looking and misleading statements that implied investor success, and contradicted the inherent risks associated with the subject investment."",
