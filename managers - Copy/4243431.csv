  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON 1/24/01 AROUND 10 PM I TOOK A CAB FROM 6TH AVE AND 52 ST.  I TOLD THE DRIVER TO TAKE ME TO RIVERDALE, I DOZED OFF FOR A FEW MINUTES.  WHEN I LOOKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS, I THEN LOOKED AT THE METER AND SAW IT WAS AROUNT $30.00, I USUALLY PAY $22-$24. I REALIZED I WAS IN YONKERS, I ASKED DRIVER TO STOP METER AND TAKE ME TO RIVERDALE,HE REFUSED. HE STARTED ARGUING  WITH ME, I ASKED HIM TO TAKE ME TO A POLICE DEPT.  THEY TOLD ME I HAD TO PAY FARE , BUT COULD FILE COMPLAINT. I REACHED IN MY BAG, MY WALLET WAS GONE.  I CALLED MY FATHER AND HE SAID HE WOULD PAY FARE.  HE SAID IT WAS OK WITH HIM, AT THIS POINT THEY ASKED ME FOR ID, I TOLD THEM MY WALLET WAS GONE.  THEY ARRESTED ME.""
