  ""Broker Comment"" : ""RR strongly disagrees with this complaint (made after he waited 2.5 years). RR asserts his records clearly demonstrate that he was acting in the former client's best interests and according to his stated goals. Former client required income in a low interest environment; RR invested in moderate, diversified, yield-producing investments, all of which continue to produce yield. RR asserts former client was sent many dollars of investment income - without complaint. RR believes the former client is reacting to market volatility. Without admitting any wrongdoing, this matter was settled to avoid the high cost of litigation.""
