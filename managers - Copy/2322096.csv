  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Regan consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he did not provide written notification to his member firm of his expanded activities nor receive permission to engage in them, before he participated in private securities transactions when his firm's customers and one additional individual purchased approximately $350,000 of the stock of a private company. The findings stated that the investment was not approved by the firm. Although Regan verbally requested permission from the firm to refer customers to the outside investment before the transactions and was granted permission to do so, Regan's participation went beyond the limited scope permitted by the firm."",
