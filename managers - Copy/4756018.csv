  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In 2012/2013 I fell behind on my mortgage due to low income, because of that, I was on the verge of foreclosure.  Midland Mortgage, my mortgage company at the time, offered to help me avoid foreclosure.  I went through the process so that i wouldn't lose my home.  Once assistance was approved, my home was refinanced under a 30 year mortgage, scheduled to be paid off in 2043.  However, since my financial situation improved, I was able to pay it off early (02/2020).  Last week I received the notice from HUD informing me, that since I paid off the mortgage loan early, the amount that they helped me with to avoid foreclosure is now due.  I am working with HUD to satisfy this lien in the next month or two.  I have already set up a payment plan with HUD.  However, I intend to take a loan from my 401k to satisfy the full amount of the lien.""
