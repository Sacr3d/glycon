  ""Allegations"" : ""FINRA RULES 2010, 2150(A), NASD RULES 2110, 2330(A), 3030, 3040: BETHEA SOLD SECURITIES IN THE FORM OF LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS IN A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY HE OWNED AND CONTROLLED, TOTALING $534,644 TO EIGHT CUSTOMERS. BETHEA DIRECTED CUSTOMERS TO PARTIALLY LIQUIDATE VARIABLE ANNUITIES HE HAD PREVIOUSLY SOLD THEM SO THEY COULD MAKE INVESTMENTS IN HIS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY. AFTER THE LIQUIDATIONS, THE PROCEEDS WERE SENT TO A THIRD-PARTY IRA CUSTODIAN FOR ALTERNATIVE, NON-TRADITIONAL INVESTMENTS. BETHEA FAILED TO PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO, OR OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM, ANY OF HIS MEMBER FIRMS BEFORE ENGAGING IN THE PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING HIS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY. BETHEA ALSO FAILED TO PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE OF HIS OPERATIONS OF AN INVESTMENT CLUB HE CREATED TO HIS FIRMS. BETHEA'S OPERATION OF THE CLUB WAS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FIRMS. ACCORDING TO BETHEA, THE PURPOSE OF THE CLUB WAS TO POOL INVESTOR FUNDS TO MAKE SECURITIES INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH THE MEMBERS WOULD RECEIVE RETURNS IN PROPORTION TO THE AMOUNT OF THEIR ORIGINAL INVESTMENT. BETHEA TRANSFERRED APPROXIMATELY $477,460 FROM THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AND FROM THE INVESTMENT CLUB BANK ACCOUNTS TO HIS PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS, WHERE THOSE FUNDS WERE COMMINGLED WITH HIS PERSONAL FUNDS. BETHEA COMMINGLED CUSTOMER FUNDS WITH HIS OWN MONEY WITHOUT THEIR AUTHORIZATION OR CONSENT. AFTER CUSTOMERS' FUNDS WERE DEPOSITED IN BETHEA'S PERSONAL ACCOUNTS, HE CONVERTED AT LEAST $93,950 TO HIS OWN USE, MAKING PAYMENTS ON HIS OWN CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT AND PAYING OTHER PERSONAL DEBTS. BETHEA ALSO MISUSED THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AND INVESTMENT CLUB FUNDS BY MAKING PAYMENTS ON LOANS SECURED BY MORTGAGES ON HIS WIFE'S PROPERTY AND ON LOANS OWNED BY PERSON WHO WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OR THE INVESTMENT CLUB. BETHEA'S CUSTOMER SOUGHT TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT AT A THIRD-PARTY IRA CUSTODIAN FOR THE PURPOSE OF HOLDING HER INVESTMENT IN THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY. WITHOUT THE AUTHORIZATION OR CONSENT OF THE CUSTOMER, BETHEA SIGNED HER NAME TO THE NEW ACCOUNT FORM REQUIRED BY THE CUSTODIAN. BETHEA SUPPLIED FALSE INFORMATION TO HIS FIRMS ON ANNUAL COMPLIANCE QUESTIONNAIRES, IN AN EMAIL AND ON AN OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITY DETAILS FORM REGARDING WHETHER HE WAS ENGAGED IN PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, HIS ACTIVITIES INVOLVING THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, WHETHER HE HAD SIGNATORY AUTHORITY ON ANY INVESTMENT OR CHECKING ACCOUNTS FOR THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, AND IF HE HAD COMMINGLED HIS FUNDS WITH HIS CUSTOMERS' FUNDS."",
