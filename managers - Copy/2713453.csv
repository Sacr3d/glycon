  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I was not aware of the arrest warrant because the Officer could not locate me as I had moved and did not change my address with the DMV.  I found out about the warrant when I applied for a part-time job in late summer and did not pass the background check.  I inquired to the court system about it and found there was an arrest warrant out for me.  I contacted the arresting Officer and met him to be processed.  I went to the arraignment and was offered to go into the ARD Program (Accelerated Rehabilitation Disposition) which I have a date 2/27/2018.""
