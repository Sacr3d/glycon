  ""Allegations"" : ""On February 11, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued this Complaint as to Defendants Criterion Wealth Management Insurance Services, Inc., Robert Allen Gravette, and Mark Andrew MacArthur. Plaintiff SEC alleges Defendants Criterion Wealth Management Insurance Services, Inc., Gravette, and MacArthur were investment advisers. They owed their clients - who entrusted them with the discretionary management of their money - a fiduciary duty to act with loyalty, fairness, and good faith. This civil enforcement action arises from defendants' breach of their fiduciary duty when failing to disclose a glaring conflict of their financial interests with those of their clients. From the spring 2014 through the summer 2017, defendants recommended that their advisory clients invest more than $16 million in four private placement funds, without disclosing that the fund managers for these investments had paid them more than $1 million in side compensation - income on top of the fees that defendants were already charging their clients directly. Because this additional side compensation was recurring and depended on Criterion's clients remaining invested in the subject funds, Criterion, Gravette, and MacArthur not only had a financial incentive to recommend that their clients invest in the first instance, they were also incentivized to keep their clients in the funds going forward, rather than allocating their capital elsewhere. For two of the private placement funds, the undisclosed compensation that defendants received reduced the investment returns that defendants' advisory clients would have otherwise received. Defendants kept their clients in the dark as to all these material facts and, in doing so, they violated their fiduciary duty and defrauded their advisory clients. What's more, these undisclosed compensation arrangements rendered Criterion's Form ADV filings with the Commission materially misleading, and no policies and procedures had been adopted and/or implemented at Criterion to prevent these compliance failures. By engaging in this conduct: Criterion violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4), and 207 of the Advisers Act; Gravette violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Advisers Act and, in the alternative, aided and abetted Criterion's violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Advisers Act; and MacArthur violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and, in the alternative, aided and abetted Criterion's violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act."",
