  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Schram consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he engaged in an outside business activity without providing written notice to his member firm. The findings stated that Schram engaged in an outside business activity for the purpose of purchasing, renovating, and reselling real estate properties for profit, through multiple limited liability companies (LLCs) that were focused on a particular real estate opportunity. Schram was involved in the management of the outside business activity, including through maintaining the books and records of the different LLCs. Schram had a reasonable expectation of compensation resulting from this business activity, which was outside the scope of his relationship with his firm. In addition, Schram did not list this business activity on an annual compliance questionnaire that he submitted to his firm. However, Schram later self-reported the activity. The findings also stated that Schram engaged in private securities transactions without providing prior written notice to his firm. Schram and a business partner formed an LLC and participated in private securities transaction by soliciting individuals, comprising his friends and family, to invest $485,000 in this particular LLC. Schram did not receive any compensation for soliciting investments, nor did he represent or otherwise suggest that the investment has been approved by his firm."",
