  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC IA Release 4934, June 4, 2018: The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) against Barbara A. Endres (Endres). On the basis of this Order and Endres' Offer, the Commission finds that on October 17, 2017, the Colorado Securities Commissioner, in In the Matter of Lifetime Wealth Advisors, LLC and Barbara Endres, Case No. 2017-CDS-055, entered an order against Endres permanently barring her from associating with any broker-dealer or investment adviser doing business in Colorado. The state level bar was entered by consent to resolve claims brought against Endres by the Colorado Division of Securities (CDS). According to the Petition filed by the CDS, from approximately September 2016 through September 2017, Endres placed a number of her clients, some of whom were elderly, into an unsuitable, highly speculative investment strategy based on the short-term trading of a single security in advance of earnings announcements without disclosing the heightened risks associated with such a strategy. Endres was also charged with making unauthorized trades in non-discretionary customer accounts and improperly retaining pre-paid advisory fees after clients terminated her services."",
