  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I HAD A FORGIVABLE LOAN THROUGH MERRILL LYNCH.  APPROXIMATELY HALF WAS FORGIVEN AT THE TIME OF THE CHAPTER 13 FILING.  MY BUSINESS HAD DROPPED OFF DRAMATICALLY WHEN I MOVED FROM MERRILL LYNCH TO AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL AND BACK AGAIN TO MERRILL LYNCH.  I LOST APPROXIMATELY 95% OF MY CLIENTS.  THE REMAINING 5% OF MY CLIENTS WERE COMMISSION BASED, WHEN THE MARKETS BECAME VERY UNSTABLE IN 2011, THE REMAINING CLIENTS MOVED FROM STOCKS TO BONDS.  AT THE TIME, BONDS PAID VERY LITTLE COMMISSION. I AM DEEPLY ASHAMED THAT I COULD NOT SAVE MY BUSINESS.  I LOST MY BUSINESS AND MY MARRIAGE ENDED IN DIVORCE. I AGREED TO $200 PER MONTH PAYMENTS FOR 60 MONTHS. I CURRENTLY HAVE APPROXIMATELY 48 MORE MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO GO.""
