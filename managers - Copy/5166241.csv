  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I PARTICIPATED IN A FESTIVAL CALLED APPLE BLOSSOM.  I WAS 19 AND IN COLLEGE STILL LEARNING THE DO'S AND DON'TS OF HAVING A GOOD TIME.  UNABLE TO FIND A BATHROOM I USED A NEARBY ALLEY AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND A POLICE OFFICER HAD FOLLOWED ME.  THE POLICE OFFICER ARRESTED ME FOR LEWD CONDUCT AND THEN ASKED FOR MY IDENTIFICATION, SURPRISED, BEWILDERED, AND CONFUSED I GAVE THE OFFICER A FALSE ID. I  QUICKLY CONFESSED AND GAVE THE OFFICER MY CORRECT ID, FOR THIS I WAS CHARGED WITH OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.  THIS INCIDENT HAS TAUGHT ME A VALUABLE LESSON I WILL CARRY WITH ME THE REST OF MY LIFE.""
