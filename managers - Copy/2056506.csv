  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CHARGE MENTIONED ABOVE WAS INCURRED WHILE MY WIFE AND I WERE GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE OF OUR MARRIAGE. I WAS RECIEVING UNUSUAL CALLS AT VARIOUS TIMES OF THE DAY/NIGHT, WITH THE OTHER PARTY HANGING UP ONCE I ANSWERED. THIS WAS UNUSUAL BECAUSE I NEVER RECIEVED THESE TYPES OF CALLS BEFORE, THEY ONLY STARTED TO TAKE PLACE ONCE MY DOMESTIC PROBLEMS BEGAN TO OCCUR. I THEN PROCEEDED TO RECORD THESE CALLS WITH A VOICE ACTIVATED MACHINE TO FIND OUT WHO THE  THE OTHER PARTY MIGHT BE AND IN THE PROCESS, THE MACHINE RECORDED SOME OF MY WIFES CALLS AND CONVERSATIONS. ONCE SHE FOUND OUT THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED, SHE TOOK THE RECORDING DEVICE TO THE POLICE AND FILED CHARGES AGAINIST ME. THIS WAS A WAY FOR HER TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE AGAINIST ME IN OUR CUSTODY FIGHT, WHICH SHE READILY ADMITTED TOO. I HONESTLY DID NOT KNOW THIS WAS A CRIME TO INTERCEPT PHONE CALLS IN MY OWN HOME, IF I HAD KNOWN THIS, I WOULD HAVE FOUND SOME OTHER MEASURES TO FIND OUT WHO WAS PLACING THE CALLS TO MY HOME.I WAS JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY AT THE TIME AND WAS NOT THINKING CLEARLY BECAUSE OF ALL THE HARDSHIP THAT MY FAMILY WAS EXPERIENCING AT THIS TIME. SINCE THEN, THE PROSECUTION HAS DECIDED TO REDUCE THE FELONY CHARGE TO A SUMMARY OFFENSE. THE COURT SAID THAT IT WILL HAVE THIS RECORD EXPUNGED FROM MY RECORD ONCE I PAY THE RESTITUTION THAT THE COURT IMPOSED ON ME AND THAT WILL HAPPEN WITHIN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS IN THE YEAR 2001. THE REASON FOR THE DELAY IS THAT I HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MY CUSTODY FIGHT AND AM EXPERIENCING SOME FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AT THIS TIME.""
