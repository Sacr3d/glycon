  ""Firm Name"" : ""Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc."",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Failure to meet performance expectations of role related to entering mutual fund trades without authorization.  No client harm occurred.  Registered representative was not in an incentive or sales-based role."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Ameriprise initially filed a U5 stating that my discharge was not compliance related. Eight days later, they amended the U5 and inserted the language concerning issues entering trades.  I disagree that I entered trades without authorization.  I worked as the Director of Investment Strategies for the office and had discussed a possible block trade for discretionary accounts with the office principals for a couple of weeks.  I later shared my intention to execute the trade, and after there was no objection, I entered it.  Subsequently, an office principal objected to the trade, and it was then canceled.  There was no customer harm and to my knowledge, no harm to the firm.""
