  ""Broker Comment"" : ""FAILURE TO PAY FUNDS THEY CLAIMED DUE THEM JUDGEMENT IN 1984, I PURCHASED 240 CALVES FROM A CATTLE BROKER IN FLORIDA, AND HAD THEM SHIPPED TO A FEED LOT IN TEXAS WHCH WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE CATTLE BROKER. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE CARE OF THE CATTLE WHILE IN THE FEEDLOT, I ARRANGED WITH A COMMUNITY BANK CLOSE TOTHE FEEDLOT TO ALLOW THE FEEDLOT OWNER/OPERATOR TO DRAFT AGAINST AN ACCOUNT (CHECKING)IN MY NAME. THE BANK OFFICER I WAS DEALING WITH WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE FEEDING OPERATOR AND WAS TO OVERSEE THE ACCOUNT TO BE SURE THE DRAFTS FOR FEED AND FEEDSTUFFS WERE TO PROVIDE FOR MY CATTLE. AFTER A FEW MONTHS, IT BECAME APPARENT THAT SOMETHING WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. WHEN I QUESTIONED BOTH THE FEEDLOT OPERATOR AND THE BANK OFFICER, I BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE AND ORDERED THAT MY CATTLE BE IMMEDIATELY SOLD, AND TO REFRAIN FROM ANY ADDITIONAL DRAFTS AGAINST MY ACCOUNT. THEY DID NOT FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS, AND CONTINUES TO FEED THE CATTLE AND DRAW MONIES FROM THE ACCOUNT. WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT THEY IGNORED MY DIRECTIONS, IT WAS TOO LATE TO SALVAGE THE VENTURE. THE BANK LITIGATED AGAINST ME FOR REFUSING TO PAY THE DEFICIT BALANCE IN MY ACCOUNTS. THEY RECEIVED A JUDGEMENT AGAINST ME. I DISCOVERED THAT THE BANK OFFICER HAD HASTILY RESIGNED AND RELOCATED TO ARIZONA. I WAS ALSO ADVISED BY THE BANK'S ATTORNEY THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL ACTIONS PENDING AS A RESULT OF HE COLLISION BETWEEN THE BANK OFFICER AND THE FEEDLOT OPERATOR. I HAVE NOT BEEN CONTACTED BY THE BANK SINCE THOSE OTHER ACTIONS WERE INITIATED. AFTER OVER $100,000 HAD PASSED THROUGH MY ACCOUNT, I REFUSED TO PAY ONLY $4000, A FRACTION OF THE AMOUNT THAT PASSED THROUGH AFTER I ISSUED THE CEASE AND DESIST TO THE OPERATOR AND BANK OFFICER.""
