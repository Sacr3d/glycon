  ""Broker Comment"" : ""WHILE STATIONED IN NORTH CAROLINA IN THE MILITARY I LEARNED OF THE POPULARITY OF HEMP WHICH GREW WILD AROUND MY HOME TOWN OF KANSAS CITY AND I BROUGHT SOME BACK TO THE BASE WITH ME ON RETURN FROM A LEAVE.  I REALLY WAS NOT AWARE OF MARIJUANA SINCE I ONLY KNEW OF WHAT WE ALWAYS CALLED HEMP. THIS LAW VIOLATION WAS CAUSED MORE FROM MY LACK OF AWARENESS THAN ANY INTENTION TO BREAK THE LAW.  THIS WAS IN THE DAYS WHEN HEMP GREW WILD BY THE ACRES IN KANSAS CITY AND I DIDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE UNTIL I WAS ARRESTED.""
