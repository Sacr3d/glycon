  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN 1991 I WAS PULLED OVER BY A POLICE OFFICER FOR A POTENTIAL TRAFFIC VIOLATION.  I THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE AN UNPAID TICKET SO I GAVE HIM MY SISTER'S NAME TO AVOID BEING DETAINED (NOT REALIZING THE SERIOUSNESS OF DOING THIS).  I RECEIVED A TICKET FOR THIS MINOR TRAFFICE VIOLATION.  I DIDN'T WANT THE TICKET TO GO ON MY SISTER'S RECORD, SO I TOLD THE SHERIFF'S DEPT. THAT IT WAS REALLY ME.  THEY TOLD ME I HAD TO GO TO COURT AND I DID.  THE JUDGE DROPPED THE TRAFFIC CHARGE , BUT SAID HE COULD NOT DISMISS THE \""GIVING FALSE INFO TO A POLICE OFFICER CHARGE.\""  ""
