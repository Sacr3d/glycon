HOWEVER, THE NASD DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT THAT THE TRADES WERE UNSUITABLE, NOTING [CUSTOMER'S] LARGE NET WORTH, AGE, PAST EXPERIENCE, ETC. [CUSTOMER] HAD OPENED AN ACCOUNT WITH ME AT SHEARSON IN MARCH, 1980.  [CUSTOMER] ENTERED INTO A DISCRETIONARY AGREEMENT WITH ME BEFORE HE LEFT ON A SIX MONTH STAY IN FRANCY.  WHILE AWAY, I SHORTED SHARES OF ATWOOD OCEANICS.  [CUSTOMER] LOST MONEY ON THESE TRADES.  HIS COMPLAINT WAS THAT THESE TRADES WERE NOT SUITABLE FOR HIS SITUATION.  I SETTLED THE LAWSUIT OUT OF COURT FOR APPROXIMATELY $8000 AND THE NASD COMPLAINT #904 FOUND (1) I HAD NOT FILED THE DISCRETIONARY PAPERS AND (2) THE TRADES WERE SUITABLE.""
