  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I did some research and had spoken to the State of NM in April concerning this matter. They informed me that my taxes for 2018 needed to be filed and there had been a discrepancy on a couple of tax returns. They asked that my accountant send in everything to have it straightened out. I then spoke with Joyce Rivera from the New Mexico State Tax & Revenue Service on 07/29/2019 and she took a payment from me over the phone. She informed me that it takes 7-10 days or even 2 weeks for the lien to be removed but she has me in the system for that to be done. Confirmation code is PSCBMR and confirmation # 2-038-642-240. She will be mailing me documentation to provide once received.""

  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Cumber consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he conducted insurance sales through a limited liability company he formed and he did not disclose any of the insurance business, residual commissions, or the existence of the company to his member firm. The findings stated that Cumber falsely attested to the firm that he was not involved in any outside business activities and repeatedly acknowledged his understanding that the receipt of residual commissions should be disclosed to the firm through an outside business activity disclosure. On two occasions, Cumber also explicitly agreed that he would not sell insurance products for any entity other than the firm without prior notice and approval. The findings also stated that Cumber engaged in 24 equity-indexed annuity sales to 20 individuals (13 of whom were the firm's customers). The sales totaled approximately $2.63 million, and Cumber earned approximately $125,000 in commissions from the associated insurance company. Also, Cumber received approximately $27,000 in trailing compensation in connection with previous sales of insurance products. These payments were received by Cumber's entity, the company. While associated with the firm, Cumber received approximately $345,000 in payments from the insurance company for sales of equity-indexed annuities and other insurance products."",
