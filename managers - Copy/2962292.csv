  ""Broker Comment"" : ""OUT-OF-STATE BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A NOW-CLOSED INVESTMENT FIRM (MARCH, 2009), WITH WHOM I CO-SIGNED ON VARIOUS BUSINESS-RELATED EXPENSES SUCH AS OFFICE SPACE LEASE, ETC., DEFAULTED ON THEIR COMMITMENTS WHEN THE 2008/2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS UNFOLDED AND CAUSED SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL HARM TO MY PARTNERS' BUSINESS SUCH THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER HONOR THEIR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS TO OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS.  I WAS LEFT ON MY OWN TO HONOR THE COMMITMENTS THAT WE MADE TO OUR LOCAL LANDLORD (LOUISVILLE, KY) AND OTHER LENDERS & BUSINESS SERVICE PROVIDERS AS MY FINANCIALLY STRESSED PARTNERS WERE LOCATED OUT OF STATE.  FOR FOUR YEARS, I HONORED AND REPAID DEBTS OUT OF PERSONAL FUNDS UNTIL MY OWN FINANCIAL SITUATION FURTHER DETERIORATED WHEN MY WIFE LOST HER JOB AT PFIZER AFTER 16 YEARS OF SERVICE.  OUR FAMILY INCOME WAS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO SATISFY THE DEMANDS OF OUR BUSINESS CREDITORS AT THE SAME RATE AND AMOUNT.  DESPITE BEARING THE BURDEN OF PAYING THESE BUSINESS EXPENSES FOR FOUR YEARS, MY CREDITORS WERE UNYIELDING; THEIR THREATS OF LITIGATION FORCED ME TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY.  WE WERE, AND ARE, A CASUALTY OF SYSTEMIC WEAKNESSES BEYOND OUR CONTROL.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MERRILL LYNCH MADE A BUSINESS A DECISION TO SETTLE THIS MATTER.  I LEFT MERRILL LYNCH  AND THE BRANCH MANAGER, THOMAS HIRSCH, TOOK IT MUCH TOO PERSONALLY.  THIS COMPLAINT MYSTERIOUSLY WAS LODGED AFTER I LEFT MERRILL LYNCH.  IN MY OPINION, THIS CLIENT WITH WHOM I HAD A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP FOR OVER FOUR YEARS WAS UNWITTINGLY DUPED INTO LODGING A COMPLAINT BY THOMAS HIRSCH AND RICHARD S. PARK, MY EX-PARTNER, AS A FORM OF RETALIATION.  CHILDISH BEHAVIOR BY GROWN MEN. THIS CLIENT AT THE TIME WAS FORTUNE 500 EXECUTIVE WORTH IN EXCESS OF $7 MILLION.  MERRILL LYNCH PAID HIM JUST OVER $8,000 AND NEVER ASKED ME FOR A DIME.  THE CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGED TO ME THAT HE WAS AWARE OF THE EARLY LIQUIDATION PENALTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMODITIES FUND IN QUESTION AND HE WAS ADVISED TO GO AHEAD AND SELL THE FUND AND INCUR THE PENALTY WITH ONLY ONE MONTH REMAINING BEFORE THE PENALTY PERIOD EXPIRED!  NOW WHO WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT STUPID? IF HE HAD WAITED ONE MORE MONTH, HE WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN HAD GROUNDS FOR A COMPLAINT BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE HAD NO DAMAGES.  THIS CLIENT CREATED HIS OWN DAMAGES.  THIS CLIENT CREATED HIS OWN DAMAGES.  YET, I WAS NEVER ASKED TO EVEN GIVE A STATEMENT OR TESTIFY!  MERRILL LYNCH JUST WROTE A CHECK ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE BRANCH MANAGER (NO SKIN OFF HIS BACK TO SPEND MERRILL LYNCH'S MONEY!) BUT MY REPUTATION WAS BESMIRCHED BY VIRTURE OF THIS COMPLAINT APPEARING ON MY NASD RECORD.  THOMAS HIRSH, BRANCH MANAGER OF THE LOUISVILLE OFFICE, GOT WHAT HE WANTED--TO PUNISH ME IN SOME WAY FOR LEAVING.  THIS WAS VERY TYPICAL OF HIS MANAGEMENT STYLE AND JUVENILE PERSONALITY.""
