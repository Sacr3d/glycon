  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS JUST OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND HAVING A PARTY.  SOME KIDS FROM ANOTHER TOWN CAME AND BROUGHT SOME FOOD THAT, UNBEKNOWNST TO ME, HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM SOMEONE'S HOME.  I TESTIFIED AGAINST THE GUILTY PARTIES AND PAID THE FINE ASSOCIATED WITH RECEIVING THE FOOD.  I STRESS THAT I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS STOLEN.  THE CASE FILE HAS BEEN DESTROYED.  IT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO AND WAS MORE IGNORANT ON MY PART THAN MALICIOUS.""
