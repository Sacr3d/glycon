IN FEBRUARY 2008, UNPRECEDENTED MARKET EVENTS CAUSED A GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS, WHICH IMPACTED THE LIQUIDITY OF THE ENTIRE $330 BILLION ARS MARKET. THIS EVENT WAS NOT FORESEEABLE BY WEDBUSH OR BROKER. MANY OTHER FIRMS HAVE PURCHASED ARS BACK FROM THEIR CLIENTS RESULTING FROM SETTLEMENTS WITH REGULATORY ORDERS DUE TO THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE AUCTIONS. WEDBUSH HAS NO REGULATORY ORDER NOR HAD ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE AUCTION PROCESS, ONLY ACTED AS AGENT CLIENT.""
