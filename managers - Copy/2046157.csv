ALTHOUGH I AM UNCERTAIN WHAT THESE CLAIMS CONCERN I BELIEVE THAT THE REASON IS THAT I PROVIDED A DISCOUNT TO A FORMER EMPLOYEE.  PROVIDING SUCH DISCOUNTS TO A FORMER EMPLOYEE WAS A COMMON PRACTICE ALTHOUGH. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A POLICY MANUAL THAT INDICATED SUCH DISCOUNTS ARE IMPROPER.   ONCE I WAS WARNED I NEVER AGAIN PROVIDED SUCH A DISCOUNT.  IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THIS REASON FOR MY TERMINATION WAS FABRICATED IN RETALIATION FOR MY COMPLAINT AGAINST A MEMBER OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT.""
