SPECIFICALLY, PRESTON WAS INVOLVED WITH THE SALE OF APPROXIMATELY $300,000 IN PROMISSORY NOTES AND COMMON STOCK, AS PART OF A PRIVATE OFFERING, TO TWO INVESTORS, BOTH OF WHOM WERE CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM AT THE TIME. PRESTON WAS INVITED TO ATTEND AN INFORMATIONAL SESSION PUT ON BY THE ISSUER OF THE PRIVATE OFFERING AT ITS FACILITIES. PRESTON INVITED TWO OF HIS FRIENDS, BOTH OF WHOM WERE CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM AT THE TIME, TO ATTEND THIS SESSION. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS MEETING, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) OF THE ISSUER MADE AN OFFER TO THE ATTENDEES TO INVEST IN THE ISSUER. PRESTON'S FRIENDS INVESTED $300,000 IN PROMISSORY NOTES AND COMMON STOCK IN THIS OFFERING. PRESTON DID NOT RECEIVE ANY COMMISSIONS FROM THE INVESTMENTS. PRESTON ALSO PERSONALLY INVESTED $20,000 IN THE OFFERING. THE PROMISSORY NOTES SOLD, ALONG WITH THE COMMON STOCK, WERE SECURITIES. PRESTON BORROWED $20,000 FROM ONE OF HIS CUSTOMERS AT HIS FIRM. HE BORROWED THE MONEY SO THAT HE COULD PERSONALLY INVEST IN THE PRIVATE OFFERING. THE CUSTOMER, A FRIEND OF PRESTON'S WHO HAD ATTENDED THE INFORMATION SESSION WITH PRESTON, MAILED A CHECK IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF $120,000 TO THE ISSUER TO PAY FOR HIS OWN $100,000 INVESTMENT AND A $20,000 INVESTMENT FOR PRESTON. THE LOAN WAS NOT REDUCED TO WRITING AND HAD NO REPAYMENT TERMS. PRESTON REPAID THE $20,000 APPROXIMATELY TWO DAYS LATER, AFTER LIQUIDATING OTHER INVESTMENTS. PRESTON DID NOT DISCLOSE THE LOAN TO HIS FIRM. THE FIRM PROHIBITED LOANS FROM CUSTOMERS WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL. MOREOVER, THIS TYPE OF LOAN WAS NOT PERMITTED BY THE FIRM'S WRITTEN PROCEDURES."",
