THEY AGREED ON MAKING THE INVESTMENTS AND SIGNED ALL THE APPROPRIATE PAPERWORK AND DISCLOSURES.  THE INVESTMENTS WERE SOLD IN APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS TO ADD DIVERSIFICATION AND INITIALLY WERE SMALL PORTIONS OF THE PORTFOLIO.  THEY WERE MEANT TO BE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS TO PROVIDE GROWTH AND INCOME FOR LATER IN RETIREMENT.  THE CLIENTS BEGAN AGGRESSIVELY LIQUIDATING THE PORTFOLIO WITH DISREGARD TO THE INITIAL PLAN IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT INFORMING ME OF ANY CHANGES TO THEIR SITUATION.  THEY THEN TRANSFERRED TO A FAMILY MEMBER WHO HAD BECOME AN ADVISOR.  MY FORMER FIRM WAS PLANNING ON DEFENDING THE CASE BUT WAS OFFERED TO SETTLE FOR THE COST OF DEFENSE.""
