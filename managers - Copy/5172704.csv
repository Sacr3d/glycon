  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In summary, I settled a $7,996 balance for $4863.98 with a one time payment followed up by 18 monthly payments.  The final of which was received by Discover Card on 10/30/2015.  The account is now closed with a $0.  I called and asked why at the beginning of the letter dated August 30th, 2017 it stated the current balance was $3,132.02 and the reason is that was the amount that was charged off/waived by Discover Card when I settled.  Which makes sense because if you take the original balance of $7996 and subtract the settlement balance of $4863.98 you get $3,132.02.""
