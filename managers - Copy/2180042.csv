  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS CUSTOMER COMPLAINT IS NO LONGER REPORTABLE. CLIENT PURCHASED 16,000 ARMSTRONG WORLD CORPORATE BONDS FOR A DISCOUNTED PRICED OF 90.042, PRINCIPAL AMOUNT BEING $14,406.72 ON OCTOBER 11,2000. ON THE DATE OF PURCHASE, MOODY'S AND STANDARD & POORS RATED THE BONDS BAA1/BBB. ADDITIONALLY ON THE DATE OF PURCHASE, THESE BONDS WERE NOT ON ANY WATCH LIST FOR POSSIBLE DOWNGRADE BY EITHER MOODY'S OR STANDARD & POORS. THE RATING OF THE BONDS WERE DISCUSSED WITH THE CLIENT BEFORE PURCHASE. THE CLIENT IS A SOPHISTICATED INVESTOR WHO HAS BOUGHT A LOT OF FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS FROM ME OVER THE YEARS. THIS CLIENT UNDERSTANDS BOND RATINGS AND THE RISK INVOLVED WITH BUYING AN INVESTMENT THAT IS NEITHER INSURED OR BACKED BY THE US GOVERNMENT. ADDITIONALLY THIS CLIENT HAS PURCHASED SOME HIGH YIELD BONDS IN THE PAST AND HAS SIGNED A HIGH YIELD BOND AGREEMENT STATING THEY UNDERSTAND BOND RATINGS AND THE RISK INVOLVED WITH INVESTING IN LOWER RATED SECURITIES. THAT SAID, THIS BOND WAS NOT CONSIDERED HIGH YIELD, BUT INVESTMENT GRADE BECAUSE OF ITS' RATING. THESE BONDS WERE NOT MISREPRESENTED TO THE CLIENT AT THE TIME OF SALE. I FEEL TERRIBLE THAT AFTER THESE BONDS WERE PURCHASED ARMSTRONG WORLD LOST A BILLION-DOLLAR LAWSUIT REGARDING ASBESTOS, WHICH WOULD CAUSE THEM TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY. I HAD NO PRIOR WAY OF KNOWING, AS NEITHER DID MOODY'S OR STANDARD & POORS, OR I AM SURE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD ARMSTRONG ON A WATCH LIST FOR POSSIBLE DOWNGRADE, THAT THEY WOULD LOSE SUCH A FINANCIAL DEVASTATING LAWSUIT. CLIENT SOLD THE BONDS ON MARCH 9, 2001 FOR $5,595.00 A LOSS OF $8,988.88.""
