  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Bode consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he did not seek member firm approval or provide the firm with written notice before engaging in outside business activities. The findings stated that Bode engaged in a consulting business, contracted with an individual to market the mineral rights she owned in connection with a property, and solicited purchase offers from energy and mineral companies, through a limited liability company (LLC) that he established with two individuals who were not associated with a firm. After Bode had been conducting business through the LLC and had been soliciting offers for the individual's mineral rights he submitted an outside business activity disclosure form to the firm. Bode stated on the form that he would buy and sell real estate, including water and mineral rights. However, Bode did not disclose the existence of the LLC or his role in it, that he had entered into a contract with the individual through the LLC or that he had marketed the individual's mineral rights. Subsequently, the individual accepted one of the purchase offers Bode solicited. The individual paid Bode $12,000, through the LLC, pursuant to the terms of the contract. Later, the firm located a copy of the LLC's contract with the individual and marketing materials for the sale of mineral rights in Bode's firm email account. In response to subsequent inquiries from the firm about these documents, Bode submitted a written statement to the firm stating, inaccurately, that the individual had not paid any fee or compensation for his work. Bode later acknowledged that the individual had paid a fee of $12,000."",
