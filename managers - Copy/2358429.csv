  ""Allegations"" : ""I was issued an insurance license in North Carolina in June of 2010 with no restrictions. In 2008 I applied for a license in North Carolina but was denied as I initially checked no on the 2008 application for prior insurance investigations. I amended the application and the state of North Carolina did not grant me a license at the time.   In April of 2010 I applied for my North Carolina insurance license again and I flew from Arizona to Raleigh, NC to meet with the deputy commissioner Robert Cunningham for the NC insurance licensing department to discuss my application request. After this meeting and reviewing my Virginia license issue they granted me a license with no restrictions.   Since my voluntary surrender of license in Virginia in 2006 I have obtained for my South Carolina license,  Brookstone Capital RIA, North Carolina license,  Arizona license, and all renewal license. I continue to be in good standing with all regulatory bodies.     I believe I have done everything possible to prove that I conduct myself in a professional manner and adhere to all insurance and security laws and regulations. I have continued to educate myself and seek ways to improve my career and the clients I serve."",

  ""Allegations"" : "". A complaint was filed in April of 2006 against me by one of Asset Management consultants clients who had an Allianz annuity that was recommended by me in 2003. The client stated that she was not aware of the surrender penalties associated with her annuity. Based on the complaint the State of Virginia contacted many of my clients and claimed that a few of them were not aware of the surrender penalties associated with their  annuity contracts. Along with this investigation the State of Virginia also investigated my former business partner and claimed similar findings.  All the clients contacted had Allianz annuities presented by my former business partner and me. The lead investigator and her superior told me that Allianz Life Insurance company was being investigated state wide at that time and in their opinion they did not see why their annuity products should be presented or sold in Virginia. I did not understand why all of the clients that were contacted by the state were all Allianz policyholders.  The client who filed the complaint stated that she was not aware of surrender penalties. I had several conversations with the client and we discussed available funds that could be withdrawn without a penalty. This client was not happy with her returns and was trying to have Allianz refund her premiums. I had worked with this client in prior years for long term care coverage and I had meet her son at her home for 2 of those meetings.   Other clients were contacted and one stated they did not fully understand there policy."",
