  ""Allegations"" : ""The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division issued this complaint as to Defendant William P. Carlson, Jr. On February 21, 2017, Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleged the following against defendant Carlson, and hereby demands a jury trial: From at least November 2012 through December 2016, Carlson, while associated with an SEC-registered investment adviser (\""Advisory Firm A\""), misappropriated more than $900,000 from one of his clients by fabricating client account withdrawal requests and forging his client's signature on authorization forms and checks. In the first few years, Carlson carried out his misappropriation scheme by directing that checks made payable to the client be issued from the client's brokerage account; arranging for overnight delivery of the checks to the client's residence; intercepting the checks upon delivery based on package tracking information; and then forging the client's endorsement of the checks to Carlson. There were at least 16 such unauthorized transactions totaling at least $437,000. In subsequent years, Carlson misappropriated funds from the client's brokerage account by forging the client's signature on authorization forms that allowed Carlson to cause a series of checks to be issued to a third-party - a friend of Carlson's - who deposited the checks into one of his own accounts and then gave the proceeds to Carlson. There were at least 25 such unauthorized transactions totaling at least $474,000. In submitting these fraudulent check requests, Carlson repeatedly caused securities held by the client to be sold and the cash diverted for Carlson's own personal use and benefit. In order to conceal and continue his scheme, Carlson sent false account statements to the client on several occasions. After the five-year span of misappropriation, Carlson had depleted most of the assets entrusted to him by this client. Through the activities alleged in this Complaint, Carlson engaged in fraudulent or deceptive conduct in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Through the activities alleged in this Complaint, Carlson also engaged in fraudulent or deceptive conduct with respect to one or more investment advisory clients, in violation of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In the alternative, Carlson aided and abetted violations of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act by Advisory Firm A."",
