  ""Broker Comment"" : ""When I was 18 years old, I was caught drinking in a dorm room by campus security guards.  I lied to the security guards and told them I did not have my wallet and provided an incorrect last name and address.  I later admitted that I had my wallet and provided the guards with the proper information.  For this omission, I was cited with \""False Reporting\"".  The charge was reduced to \""Attempt of a class 1 misdemeanor\"".  The conviction was set aside and nullified by the Lancaster County Court on October 17, 2016.""
