  ""Broker Comment"" : ""WHILE WORKING AT MARSHALL FIELDS, I KNEW OF A PERSON WHO WOULD FORGE CREDIT CLIPS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE CASH FOR PURCHASES WHICH WERE NOT ORIGINALLY PURCHASED. THIS PERSON FORGED MY NAME TO A CREDIT SLIP WHICH I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT. SECURITY CALLED ME IN FOR QUESTIONING. THEY ASKED IF I HAD SIGNED THE CREDIT SLIP. I TOLD THEM NO, BUT THEY SAID THEY HAD MY NAME ON IT. THEY TOOK ME AND THE OTHER PERSON DOWN TO THE POLICE STATION FOR FURTHER QUESTIONING. THEY WANTED TO PRESS CHARGES. WE WERE HELD UNTIL WE COULD SEE A JUDGE. ONCE I WENT BEFORE THE JUDGE, I WAS RELEASED TO MY MOTHER. WE MADE 3 APPEARANCES IN COURT BECAUSE THE MARSHALL FIELDS REP DID NOT SHOW. ON THE THIRD APPEARANCE, MY LAWYER TALKED TO THE MARSHALL FIELD'S REP. THEY DECIDED THAT BECAUSE I KNEW OF THE PERSON SIGNING THE CREDIT SLIPS, I WOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED GUILTY. THEY CAME TO AN AGREEMENT THAT I WOULD PAY RESTITUTION OF $40.00 TO MARSHALL FIELDS, COURT COSTS AND HAVE A 1 YEAR SUPERVISION. ONCE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED (SUPERVISION), I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE A RECORD. WHEN I FINISHED SUPERVISION, WHICH WAS CHECKING IN WITH SOMEONE EVERY 3-4 MONTHS, THEY TOLD ME EVERYTHING WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF AND THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE A RECORD.""
