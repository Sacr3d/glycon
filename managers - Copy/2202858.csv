  ""Judgment/Lien Type"" : ""Tax"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Lien filed by the IRS regarding their claim of back taxes owed which is in the process of being disputed. It is resulting from extension tax filings for 2011 when I made very little income.  I am in the process of hiring a firm, BC Tax, to represent me on this matter with the IRS to  clarify and negotiate the correct amount of taxes owed based on filing amended tax  returns for 2011. The IRS based their calculations of taxes owed on income reported in prior years when I had higher income. The matter will be cleared once I file an amended 1040 for 2011 which will show to the IRS that my itemized deductions and child tax credits reduces my income to a much lower amount of taxes owed.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS WAS SETTLED FOR CONVENIENCE BY MY FORMER FIRM. THE RECOMMENDATION WAS SUITABLE BASED ON THE CLIENT SPECIFICALLY ASKING TO HAVE THE REMAINING UNUSED PROCEEDS OF $60,000 FROM HER DECEASED SPOUSE'S LIFE INSURANCE POLICY TO BE INVESTED FOR THE BENEFIT OF HER CHILDREN. BASED ON HER REQUEST, I RECOMMENDED A SINGLE PREMIUM LIFE CONTRACT WHICH PROVIDED FOR A $129,000 DEATH BENEFIT PAYABLE TO HER CHILDREN FOR A $60,000 DEPOSIT. THE CLIENT SIGNED DISCLOSURE ACKNOWLEDGING THE MARKET RISKS AND SURRENDER CHARGES RELATED TO THIS CONTRACT. WHEN THE MARKET WAS RISING, THE CLIENT WANTED TO LIQUIDATE A CD IN AN IRA TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT INTO MUTUAL FUNDS HELD IN AN IRA. I RECOMMENDED AGAINST THIS. HOWEVER, WHEN THE MARKET WENT INTO DECLINE, THE CLIENT PANICKED AND LIQUIDATED THE EXISTING MUTUAL FUND POSITION THUS LOCKING IN A LOSS. THIS WAS STRICTLY A CASE OF A CLIENT BEING UPSET OVER LOSING MONEY IN A WIDESPREAD MARKET DOWNTURN DESPITE THE ORIGINAL RECOMMENDATIONS BEING SUITABLE INCLUDING ALL DISCLOSURES AND RISKS BEING FULLY DISCUSSED AND UNDERSTOOD BY THE CLIENT.""
