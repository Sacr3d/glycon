  ""Broker Comment"" : ""1/8/09 [CUSTOMER] CAME TO ME TO SET UP AN ACCOUNT WHERE HE WOULD BE RECEIVING MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE ACCOUNT.  WHEN THE FUNDS WERE RECEIVED ALONG WITH THE COURT ORDER WITH RESTRICTIONS FOR DISTRIBUTIONS, I WAS ADVISED BY MY COMPLIANCE PRINCIPLE SPECIALIST TO FAX IT TO MY NEW BUSINESS DEPARTMENT TO RESTRICT THE ACCOUNT PER THE ORDER.  [CUSTOMER] CONTINUED TO RECEIVE MONTHLY DISTRIBUIONS AND OVER A YEAR LATER HE HAD ASKED ME FOR ALL THE FUNDS IN THE ACCOUNT TO BUY A HOUSE.  I PROCESSED HIS REQUEST NOT KNOWING THAT THE RESTRICTIONS WERE NOT SET UP AND THE FUNDS LEFT HIS ACCOUNT.  ON MARCH 31, 2010 I RECEIVED A CALL FROM HIS ATTORNEY AND THE COMPLIANT WAS SUBMITTED FOR UNAUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTION.  MY COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT TOOK THE CASE OVER.""
