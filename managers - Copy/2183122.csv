  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I vehemently deny any and all allegations.  This is an absolute and wholly frivolous claim, and potentially fraudulent based on the facts at hand.  Factually, I was not employed at Aegis Capital in February 2011 as the client is stating.  Furthermore, I was not a broker on record for one account until February 2015 and for the other account I was only broker on record for 1 month.  Factually, a significant majority of the positions/activity the client is seeking recovery on was done/purchased prior to me becoming a broker on record and prior to me even being employed at Aegis Capital.   Factually, the equity of the account was never even close to $300,000 and there is no basis for the amount of this claim. I am seeking to be removed from this claim entirely.  In addition, much of the activity the client is claiming was unsuitable was done at the direction of the client and on an unsolicited basis.  Furthermore, after transferring the account away, the client sold a stock, which he purchased through a private placement prior to his account coming to Aegis in February 2011, that was at .02 when he transferred out and subsequently traded over $7.00 per share and missed out on over a $340,000 potential gain.  He is very upset with himself and is looking to seek recovery in places that are not warranted.  I will seek to enter a counterclaim against this client to the fullest extent as permitted by industry regulations.""
