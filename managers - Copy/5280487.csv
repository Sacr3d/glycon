I ALSO DID EXTENSIVE HOMEWORK RESEARCHING HOW THE PRODUCT WORKS USING THE MATERIALS AND RESOURCES THAT UBS PROVIDED. SOME OF THE \""PRINCIPAL PROTECTED NOTES\"" WERE ISSUED BY LEHMAN BROTHERS, AND WHEN LEHMAN BROTHERS DECLARED BANKRUPTCY MY CLIENTS AND I LEARNED THAT THE \""PRINCIPAL PROTECTED NOTES\"" THAT WERE ISSUED BY LEHMAN BROTHERS WERE NOT PRINCIPAL PROTECTED AT ALL. I HAVE HELPED FINRA INVESTIGATE UBS BY PARTICIPATING IN A DEPOSITION. I HAVE RETAINED MY CLIENTS THAT BOUGHT THESE NOTES AND THEY ARE CURRENT CLIENTS OF MINE AT HILLIARD LYONS.""
