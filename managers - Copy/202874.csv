  ""Allegations"" : ""WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS EVANS CONSENTED TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT DUE TO INADEQUATE FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING CONTROLS, EVANS' MEMBER FIRM HAD MULTIPLE NET CAPITAL DEFICIENCIES, FOR WHICH EVANS, ITS CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER, WAS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE, AND THE FIRM CONDUCTED A SECURITIES BUSINESS WHILE OPERATING UNDER ITS NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENT. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT THERE WERE OPERATIONAL AND ACCOUNTING ERRORS THAT LED TO THE NET-CAPITAL VIOLATIONS. THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE AN ADEQUATE PROCESS FOR TRACKING ITS CONCESSIONS AND MANAGEMENT-FEE RECEIVABLES. THE FIRM INSTEAD RELIED ON ESTIMATES THAT EVANS PROVIDED, RATHER THAN ON RECORDS OF ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM DID NOT EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE ITS OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES TO ITS FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONS PRINCIPAL (FINOP), WHO WORKED FROM ANOTHER STATE. THE FINOP WAS ROUTINELY UNABLE TO SUBSTANTIATE FINANCIAL NUMBERS PROVIDED BY THE FIRM OR TO VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF JOURNAL ENTRIES OF DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS IN THE FIRM'S ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. THE FIRM'S PROCEDURES FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE WERE ALSO DEFICIENT. EVANS WAS SUPPOSED TO REVIEW THE EMAILS AND MOVE THEM TO A SEPARATE FOLDER ON HIS COMPUTER FOR RETENTION. A SUBSEQUENT REVIEW SHOWED THAT THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES DID NOT COPY EVANS ON ALL RELEVANT CORRESPONDENCE, AND THAT EVANS DID NOT TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THEY DID. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM FAILED TO CONDUCT THE NECESSARY REVIEW OF ELECTRONIC CORRESPONDENCE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM FAILED TO DEVELOP A SUPERVISORY SYSTEM AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS PREVIOUS VIOLATIONS THAT FINRA IDENTIFIED IN AN EXAMINATION."",
