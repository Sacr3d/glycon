DOHERTY RETRIEVED THE NEW ACCOUNT FORM, WHICH HAD BEEN SIGNED BY THE CUSTOMER BUT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED IN WRITING BY THE BROKER OR THE BRANCH OFFICE MANAGER. DOHERTY WAS UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL SIGNATURES THAT DAY BECAUSE THE BROKER AND THE BRANCH OFFICE MANAGER HAD LEFT FOR THE DAY. DOHERTY THEN PROCEEDED TO COPY THEIR SIGNATURES FROM ANOTHER NEW ACCOUNT FORM WITHOUT THE BROKER'S OR THE BRANCH OFFICE MANAGER'S AUTHORIZATION, KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT. DOHERTY THEN AFFIXED THE SIGNATURES TO THE CUSTOMER'S NEW ACCOUNT FORM AND FAXED THE FORM TO THE FIRM'S MARGIN CLERK."",
