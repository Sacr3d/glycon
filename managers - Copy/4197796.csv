  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The rep was previously unaware of this lien and is working with the IRS to get it taken care of. Also, the rep was unable to find court records about the filing and has been working directly with the IRS so the only court action information available for question 5 was taken from the FINRA disclosure letter.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""QUICK & REILY'S ALLEGATIONS, FIRST AND FOREMOST ARE GROUNDLESS AS TO MY BEING TERMINATED. I RESIGNED FROM QUICK & REILY ON JULY 11, 2003 TO ACCEPT A BETTER POSITION WITH A MORE REPUTABLE BROKER/DEALER. I DID EMAIL CLIENT INFORMATION TO MY HOME AT A EARLIER TIME TO FACILITATE SEMINAR MAILINGS BECAUSE I WAS NOT GETTING ASSISTANCE AT THE OFFICE AS PROMISED. I WAS TOLD NOT TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE AND WAS TOLD TO DESTROY THE FILES I HAD SENT. I DESTROYED THEM. NO OTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN. I BELIEVE THIS DISCLOSURE WAS ADDED TO MY U-5 TO INHIBIT MY ABILITY TO CONTINUE EMPLOYMENT IN THE INVESTMENT FIELD.""
