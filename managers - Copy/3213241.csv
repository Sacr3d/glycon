  ""Broker Comment"" : ""DURING THE SPRING OF 1993 I WAS A STUDENT AT WEST TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY GRADUATE SCHOOL I ALSO HELD A FULL TIME JOB.  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER I HAD PURCHASED ALL OF MY TEXT BOOKS FROM THE UNIVERSITY BOOKSTORE BY CHECK.  I RELOCATED AND DID NOT NOTIFY THE SCHOOL OF MY NEW ADDRESS.  THE CHECK WAS RETURNED INSUFFICIENT AND I WAS NOT NOTIFYED.  I WAS NOT AWARE THERE WAS A WARRANT ISSUED UNTIL I WAS ARRESTED.  AT THAT TIME I DID SATISFY THE COURT COST.  THE BEST I CAN REMEMBER I HAD ALREADY PICKED UP THE CHECK AT THE SCHOOL.""
