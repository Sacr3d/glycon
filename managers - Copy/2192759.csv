  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In 2007, I purchased an out of state business with two out of state business partners.  My partners managed and operated the business while I provided financial assets to facilitate the transaction, including personally guaranteeing a seven figure loan to complete the purchase.  After the economic crisis of 2008, the business failed and my guarantee was called which resulted in me having to declare Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.  This bankruptcy is fully discharged.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""These two business partners made extensive use of a CPA in their decision to purchase Guardian Variable Universal Life insurance policies to fund the buy/sell agreement they put in place for their business.  A comprehensive review by the Compliance Department found no wrong doing on the part of the representative that put these two policies in place and whom I supervised.  Unfortunately, Park Avenue Securities failed to include an arbitration clause in their New Account Form used when these policies were purchased.  That failure to include an arbitration clause allowed these insureds to sue in civil court after the downturn in the market affected the values in their policies.  Guardian settled without admitting fault rather than continue to pay for legal fees related to this civil case.""
