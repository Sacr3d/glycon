  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE INCIDENT THAT IS THE CAUSE OF THE MISUNDERSTANDING WITH THE FAA HAPPENED IN FEBRUARY 2001 WHILE I WAS ON A SKI TRIP TO JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING.  MY WIFE AND I HAD SPENT THE AFTERNOON IN THE PUB AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL WITH SEVERAL FRIENDS.  MOST OF THE GROUP HAD CONSUMED A LARGE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL BY THE EARLY EVENING, AND I WAS NOMINATED AS THE PERSON WHO WAS MOST ABLE TO DRIVE US ALL HOME.  I HAD STOPPED DRINKING SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE AND THOUGHT THAT I WAS LEGAL TO DRIVE.  A LOCAL SHERIFF HAD WATCHED ALL SEVEN OF US TRY TO PILE INTO ONE CAR AND PULLED US OVER IMMEDIATELY AS WE LEFT THE PARKING LOT.  AT THIS TIME I WAS GIVEN A BREATHALYZER, FAILED THE TEST, AND WAS CHARGED WITH DUI.  UPON REVIEW OF THE FACTS, TO MY RELIEF, THE LOCAL PROSECUTOR DECIDED TO DROP THE DUI CHARGES.  AT THAT TIME, I WAS A RESIDENT OF ILLINOIS, DRIVING WITH AN ILLINOIS DRIVER'S LICENSE.  BECAUSE THE DUI CHARGES WERE DROPPED, NOTHING WAS EVER FORWARDED TO THE STATE OF ILLINOIS REGARDING THE INCIDENT AND MY ILLINOIS DRIVER'S LICENSE REMAINED INTACT.  APPARENTLY, THE STATE OF WYOMING AT THAT TIME HAD A POLICY OF AUTOMATICALLY SUSPENDING THE DRIVING PRIVILEGES OF ANYONE WHO FAILS A BREATHALYZER, WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CONVICTED OF THE CHARGE.  IT IS CALLED A \""STATUTORY SUMMARY SUSPENSION.\""  BUT BECAUSE I WAS LICENSED IN ILLINOIS, THIS DID NOT IMPACT MY ILLINOIS DRIVER'S LICENSE.  IT TURNS OUT, HOWEVER, THAT MY DRIVING PRIVILEGES HAD BEEN REVOKED WITHIN THE STATE OF WYOMING.  THIS FACT WAS PROBABLY BURIED WITHIN THE PAPERWORK FORWARDED BY MY WYOMING ATTORNEY, BUT I WAS SO FOCUSED ON THE RESOLUTION OF THE DUI CHARGES AND THE FACT THAT I WAS ABLE TO RETAIN MY ILLINOIS DRIVER'S LICENSE THAT I WAS UNAWARE OF THE ISSUE REGARDING MY WYOMING DRIVING PRIVILEGES.  BECAUSE I LIVED IN ILLINOIS, I WAS UNAFFECTED BY THE TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF MY WYOMING DRIVING PRIVILEGES.  THEN, IN 2008 I DECIDED TO TAKE SOME FLYING LESSONS AS I HAD DECIDED TO PURSUE A PRIVATE PILOT'S LICENSE.  WHEN I APPLIED FOR MY STUDENT FLYING CERTIFICATE, I WAS ASKED ON THE APPLICATION WHETHER MY DRIVING LICENSE HAD EVER BEEN REVOKED AS THE RESULT OF A DRUG OR ALCOHOL RELATED OFFENSE.  AFTER CONSIDERING THAT THE DUI CHARGES WITH RESPECT TO THE ABOVE INCIDENT HAD BEEN DROPPED AND THAT MY ILLINOIS DRIVER'S LICENSE WAS NEVER SUSPENDED, I ANSWERED NO TO THE QUESTION.  WHEN THE FAA DID A SEARCH AFTER RECEIVING MY APPLICATION FOR A PILOT'S CERTIFICATE, THEY RECEIVED A REPORT FROM WYOMING THAT MY DRIVING PRIVILEGES HAD BEEN SUSPENDED IN 2001 FOR THE FAILED BREATHALYZER.  UPON RECEIVING THIS INFORMATION THE FAA CONCLUDED THAT I HAD MADE AN \""INCORRECT STATEMENT\"" ON MY APPLICATION FOR A PILOT MEDICAL CERTIFICATE AND REVOKED MY STUDENT PILOT MEDICAL CERTIFICATE. THE FAA EXPLAINED THAT MY INCORRECT ANSWER TO THE QUESTION RESULTED FROM THE FACT THAT I WAS BOTH UNAWARE, AT THE TIME I COMPLETED THE MEDICAL CERTIFICATE APPLICATION, OF THE WYOMING SUSPENSION OF MY DRIVING PRIVILEGES AND THAT THE WYOMING SUSPENSION REQUIRED A YES ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ON THE FAA MEDICAL CERTIFICATE APPLICATION.  IN RETROSPECT, I UNDERSTAND THAT THE WYOMING INCIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN OF CONCERN TO THE FAA IN EVALUATING MY FITNESS TO RECEIVE A PRIVATE PILOT'S LICENSE.  I SHOULD HAVE, THEREFORE, ERRED ON THE SIDE OF DISCLOSING THE INCIDENT BEING UNSURE WHETHER THE DISCLOSURE WAS REQUIRED.  IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT I AM DISCLOSING THIS DIPUTE WITH THE FAA REGARDING MY ANSWER ON THE PILOT MEDICAL CERTIFICATE APPLICATION.  AS THE CORRESPONDENCE INDICATES, THE FAA CONCLUDED IN THE 5TH PARAGRAPH OF PAGE 2 OF THEIR LETTER THAT EVEN IF MY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION AT ISSUE \""WAS NOT INTENTIONALLY FALSE OR FRAUDULENT...THEN (MY) INCORRECT STATEMENT...(WAS) STILL THE BASIS FOR REVOCATION.""
