  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IR STATED THAT AT THE TIME OF THE BOND PURCHASE, HE INDICATED THAT THE INTEREST RATE ON THE BOND WAS 4.625% AND THE CLIENT WOULD EARN THAT RATE ON THE FACE AMOUNT OF $75,000.   IR ALSO STATED HE INFORMED THE CLIENT THAT THE VALUE OF THE BOND WOULD RISE OR FALL DEPENDING ON THE INTEREST RATES, BUT IF THE CLIENT HELD THE BOND UNTIL MATURITY THE CLIENT WOULD RECEIVE THE FULL $75,000.  IR STATED HE DID FORGET TO MENTION THE $163.80 THAT WAS DUE IN ACCRUED INTEREST, BUT DID CALL THE CLIENT TO INFORM HIM OF SUCH.  BASED ON OUR INVESTIGATION, IT APPEARS THIS TRANSACTION WAS HANDLED APPROPRIATELY BY THE IR; THEREFORE, NO ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE TO THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNT.  CLIENT WAS ADVISED THAT IF HE BELIEVED CHANGES TO HIS PORTFOLIO WERE NECESSARY TO PLEASE CONTACT THE CURRENT INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIVE. THIS EVENT IS NO LONGER REPORTABLE.""
