  ""Firm Name"" : ""THE STUTLAND VOLATILITY GROUP, LLC"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""VIOLATION OF THE FIRM'S WRITTEN POLICY ON REPORTING OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AS REQUIRED BY THE FIRM'S SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES AND CODE OF ETHICS WHICH REQUIRES, IN PART, TO NOTIFY THE FIRM'S CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER OF THE NATURE AND EXPANSION OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY ACTIVITIES WITH HIS OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT WITH ANOTHER INVESTMENT ADVISORY FIRM."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The Stutland Volatility Group (\""SVG\"") incorrectly states that I violated the firm's written policy on reporting outside employment activities by providing services to another investment adviser that were outside of the narrow scope of allowed business. Additionally, SVG incorrectly states that my termination type was \""Discharged\"" when in fact I resigned. SVG's Written Supervisory Procedures nor the firms Code of Ethics were ever updated to define this \""narrow scope\"" indicated in the filing. While I was employed at SVG, I was never given, written or verbally, a definition of the scope within which I was to operate as a registered representative of KKM Financial. On May, 11 2015 SVG's CCO sent an email to the CEO of KKM Financial and to me explaining my expanding role and transition to KKM Financial prior to the alledged infraction (copy of email available). As of November 2015 I was still listed on SVG's ADV. The mis-statements in SVG's ADV attest to SVG's extreme state of disorder and sloppy compliance policies. The primary reason I chose to resign from SVG was due to the fact that I was issued an ultimatum from the principals at SVG. I was told I would have to sign an \""after-the-fact\"" employment contract and an \""after-the-fact\"" non-disclosure agreement with SVG or leave the building. These agreements appeared to run contrary to the arrangement which was established between SVG's CCO the CEO of KKM Financial and me. I indicated I would need some time for consideration at which time the both principals became very hostile towards me. I felt this was not a good faith effort to negotiate these after-the-fact agreements, much less discuss the allegations levied against KKM's CEO. Feeling like I was being bullied and coerced, I chose to leave the SVG office, effectively resigning. SVG's U5 filing alleges I was terminated because KKM's website indicated I was operating outside of the narrowly tailored services that were authorized by SVG. I was never presented with the scope of this \""narrowly tailored\"" arrangement. There was no attempt to update the Written Supervisory Procedure's or Code of Ethics to specifically address the alleged \""narrowly tailored\"" scope or what would be considered outside of said scope. SVG's CCO was well aware of my dual registration at both firms. KKM's ADV and ADV Part 2 was updated accordingly.""
