I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE, DIVERSIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE OF HER INVESTMENTS.  AS TO [CUSTOMER'S] NET WORTH, HER LIQUID NET WORTH WAS ABOUT $109K AND HER NET WORTH INCLUDING HER HOME, AUTO, AND FURNISHINGS WAS $250K PLUS. I NEVER ASKED [CUSTOMER] TO OVERSTATE HER NET WORTH FOR THE PURPOSE OF QUALIFYING FOR THIS INVESTMENT. WHEN SHE PHONED ME ABOUT THE NET WORTH QUALIFICATION, I REFERRED TO MY PALM PILOT (I WAS IN THE FIELD AS USUAL) AND NOTED HER LIQUID NET WORTH AS BEING $250K. THIS WAS AN OVERSIGHT ON MY PART, HAVING INCLUDED HER HOME IN ERROR ALONG WITH HER INVESTMENTS IN THE LIQUID NET WORTH FIGURE IN MY ELECTRONIC NOTES. I TOLD HER ACCORDING TO MY INFORMATION, SHE DID IN FACT QUALIFY AND IT WAS ALRIGHT TO SIGN THE BEHRINGER HARVARD SUBSCRIPTION DOCUMENT, AND HER INVESTMENT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR HER OBJECTIVE OF INCOME AND GROWTH FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. AS TO THE STATE OF FLORIDA, I AM REGISTERED IN OHIO TO CONDUCT SECURITIES BUSINESS AS WELL AS FLORIDA. WHERE THE APPLICATION WAS SIGNED HAD NO BEARING AND I DO NOT RECALL THIS IN CONVERSATION WITH [CUSTOMER] CONCERNING THE BEHRINGER HARVARD OPPORTUNITY REIT.\""""
