  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CAR ACCIDENT-A TAXI DRIVER DELIBERATELY HIT THE BACK OF MY CAR SO HARD THAT HE INJURED HIMSELF ON THE STEERING WHEEL. I TOOK HIM HOSPITAL. A FEW WEEKS LATER HE TOLD POLICE I HIT HIM.  IT WENT TO COURT  & I WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY. THIS IS TO INFORM YOU THAT THE INFORMATION Y0U HAVE IS INCOMPLETE AND INCORRECT.  THIS ACTION WAS THE RESULT OF A TAXI DRIVER DELIBERATELY HITTING THE BACK OF MY STOPPED CAR.  HE SUFFERED INJURIES THAT HE CAUSED HIMSELF WHEN HIS HEAD HIT THE STEERING WHEEL OF HIS CAR.  AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DROVE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL, AND FILED AN ACCIDENT REPORT WITH BOTH THE POLICE AND MY INSURANCE COMPANY.  A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE ACCIDENT, THE DRIVER PRESSED ASSAULT CHARGES AGAINST ME. NORMALLY THIS WOULD HAVE NEVER GONE TO TRIAL, HOWEVER DUE TO SOME ~BAD PRESS~ IN THE QUEEN`S DA OFFICE AT THE TIME, THEY WERE NOT DISMISSING ANY COMPLAINTS. THE TRIAL LASTED A FEW HOURS, AND I WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY. IF THE FBI COULD FIND THIS INFORMATION, FROM 9/22/1972, THEN THEY SHOULD OF BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE COMPLETE INFORMATION, AND RESULT.""
