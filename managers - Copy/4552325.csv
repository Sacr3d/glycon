Respondent failed to request termination of his suspension within three months of the date of the Notice of Suspension; therefore, he is automatically barred from association with any FINRA member in any capacity.  February 22, 2016: Parris filed an Application for Review of the January 21, 2016 Bar from Association pursuant to FINRA Rule 9552. March 1, 2016: FINRA submitted to the SEC a Brief in Opposition to Motion to Stay.  On August 24, 2016, the SEC set aside the bar imposed by FINRA. In so doing, the SEC left in place FINRA's November 9, 2015 suspension of Parris.""
