  ""Allegations"" : ""Customer sought legal help from the firm of Firth, Johnston, Bunn, Kerr, et al., in El Paso Texas.  Legal firm alleges (in a letter dated 29 Feb 2016 and sent to Agent Mike Halpin) that Agent Halpin allowed unauthorized withdrawals to be taken from Mr Garcia's State Farm deferred life annuity by Ms Berniece De Vries over about a 3 year period.  During this time frame, a legally executed Power of Attorney naming Ms De Vries as Mr Garcia's POA for all financial affairs was in effect and allowed Ms De Vries authority to make such withdrawals.  Agent Halpin filled out about 3 such withdrawal requests which were signed by Ms De Vries as Mr Garcia's POA.  These requests were forwarded to State Farm Life Company by the agent for final disposition and electronic deposit of the moneies requested AFTER their review of the in-power POA in each case.  A legal reply to the above letter was issued by State Farm Legal on 8 March 2016.  After conducting a thorough review of all the matters associated with this allegation, the reply denied any wrongdoing and also denied to replenish Mr Garcia's annuity which had been requested by the firm representing him.
