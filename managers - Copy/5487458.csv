  ""Broker Comment"" : ""AN EX-BUSINESS PARTNER FILED BANKRUPTCY.  THE COURT CLAIMED THAT PAYMENTS HE MADE TO ME FOR THE PURCHASE OF UNIMPROVED LAND IN THE AMOUNT OF $40,000 WAS OWED TO THE COURT. I USED THE $40,000 ALONG WITH ANOTHER PARTNERS $40,000 AND MY $60,000 TO PURCHASE 4 LOTS.  WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 10-12 MONTHS OF THE PURCHASE DATE HE FILED BANKRUPTCY.  THE COURT CLAIMED MARKET VALUE AT THE TIME WAS TWICE WHAT IT WAS WHEN WE PURCHASED THE PROPERTIES.  I HIRED A LAWYER AND SETTLED FOR THE ORIGINAL $40,000 (ORIGINAL INVESTMENT).  I PAID THIS AMOUNT IN LATE 2006.  I WAS UNAWARE AND NEVER NOTIFIED THAT THEY WENT BACK TO COURT AND WON A JUDGMENT FOR AN ADDITIONAL $37,000.""
