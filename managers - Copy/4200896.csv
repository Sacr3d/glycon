  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I was permitted to resign due to failing to follow bank procedures related to the transfer of a TD Bank Deposit Account within TD Bank in my capacity as a relationship manager for TD Bank, NA.  This transfer was unrelated to my role as a registered representative of TD Private Client Wealth, but was performed in my capacity as a relationship manager for TD Bank, NA.  This transfer changed the product type and not the account number.  I did not misappropriate any of the client's funds.""
