  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I was unaware that this was an outstanding judgment as I was in an agreed upon payment arrangement with this creditor.  I am in  an agreement to pay this in full monthly. Upon finding out about this, I have been in contact with the creditors to find out why this occurred as I had an agreement in place previously.  I have also contacted an attorney to find out what my options are in regards to all of this.""
