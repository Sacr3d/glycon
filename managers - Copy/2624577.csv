  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I REMOVED A STOP SIGN IN CENTERVILLE VA WITHIN A CONDO COMPLEX FROM ITS POSITION TO MY CONDO.  THE CONDO ASSOCIATION MEMBERS SAW THIS AS A THEFT OF THEIR PROPERTY.  THE COURTS SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD NOT MOVE ANY MORE STOP SIGNS FROM THE RIGHTFUL PLACE TO MY CONDO.  I WAS OF THE OPINION THAT THIS WAS STRICKEN FROM MY RECORD SOME 13 YRS AGO.  HENCE, I AM SURPRISED THAT IT STILL IS PRESENT.  THANK YOU.""
