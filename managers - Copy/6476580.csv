  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON OCTOBER 08,2011 I WAS ARRESTED FOR FLEEING AND ELUDING.  I WAS HIT BY ANOTHER DRIVER AND PULLED AWAY INTO A SAFER LOCATION SINCE THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION.  I PULLED OVER LESS THAN A QUARTER MILE FROM WHERE THE ACCIDENT TOOK PLACE AND DUE TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE VALIDITY OF THE CHARGES WERE QUESTIONED.  THESE CHARGES WERE PROMPTLY DROPPED AND I HAVE ATTACHED THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS.  I DID NOT INCLUDE THIS INITIALLY AS MY LAWYER INFORMED ME THAT THESE CHARGES WERE SEALED AND I UNDERSTOOD THIS TO MEAN THAT I DID NOT NEED TO DISCLOSE THESE EVENTS.""
