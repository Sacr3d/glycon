  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Rizer consented to the sanction and to the entry of findings that he converted funds from the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors (NAIFA) by making $1,979 in unauthorized personal charges on a debit card issued to him by the non-profit group for which he was serving as president of a local chapter. The findings stated that Rizer made no attempt at any time to reimburse the charges. Rizer disclosed NAIFA to his member firm as an outside business activity. NAIFA authorized Rizer to use the debit card for expenses incurred while recruiting new members. However, Rizer used the debit card to pay for the personal expenses unrelated to his work for NAIFA."",
