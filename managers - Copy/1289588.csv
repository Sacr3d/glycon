I WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND (INNOCENT BECAUSE 1) I NEVER SOLD STOCK SHORT- I SOLD IT LONG BECAUSE I WAS ALLOCATED SHARES FROM THE SECONDARY BEFORE I SOLD THE STOCK 2) I CONSULTED WITH AN ATTORNEY BEFORE DOING THIS THEREBY REMOVING ANY CRIMINAL INTENT, POSSIBILITIES 3) MANIPULATION WAS IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO HIGH LIQUIDITY OF SHARES INVOLVED 4) THERE WAS NO COLLUSION WHATSOEVER 5) THE PUBLIC DID NOT SUFFER FROM MY ACTIONS 6) THE SEC SHOULD EDUCATE THE PUBLIC OF THIS RULE NOT PROSECUTE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT KNOW RULE EXISTED.  I WAS FIRST PERSON ACCUSED OF VIOLATING THIS 5 YEAR OLD RULE.""
