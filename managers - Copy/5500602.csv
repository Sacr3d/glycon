  ""Broker Comment"" : ""WITH REGARD TO CASE NUMBER PA 029419, THE FOLLOWING SERVES AS MY SUMMARY OF THE FACTS, TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION. I WAS APPROACHED BY MY COLLEAGUE, THE COLLEAGUE REQUESTED MY SIGNATURE TO AUTHORIZE A TRANSACTION, IN THE AMOUNT OF $5,000. I AUTHORIZED THE TRANSACTION BUT DID NOT REALIZE UNTIL LATER IT WAS A FRAUDALENT TRANSACTION. AT THE TIME I WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN EMPLOYMENT WITH ANOTHER COMPANY AND THE COLLEAGUE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY HECTIC STATE OF TRYING TO WRAP UP MY OUTSTANDING ASSIGNMENTS WORK. AT NO TIME DID I INTENTIONALLY OR WILLINGLY TO PARTICIPATE. AT WORST, I ACTED CARELESSLY, BUT NOT DISHONESTLY. THE CUSTOMER BROUGHT CHARGES AGAINST ME DUE TO MY PART IN THE AUTHORIZATION.  BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER WAS ULTIMATELY WRONGED, REGARDLESS OF MY LACK OF INTENT, I ADMITTED TO THE CHARGES, PAID RESTITUTION, PERFORMED 100 HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE AND SERVED PROBATION. I FELT THAT IS WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I BELIEVED AFTER A YEAR OR TWO YEARS OF PROBATION, THE COURT REDUCED MY OFFENSE TO A MIDEMEANOR, VACATING THE PREVIOUS PLEA GUILTY (THEREBY ENTERING A PLEA OF NOT GUILTY) AND ULTIMATELY DISMISSED THE ACTION.""
