  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN MARCH OF 76, I ACCOMPANIED A YOUNG MAN WHO I THOUGHT WAS MY FRIEND TO BONWIT TELLER DEPT STORE. WHILE SHOPPING HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD PURCHASE AN ITEM WITH HIS AUNT'S CREDIT CARD BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER SINCE HE WAS A GUY.  HE ALSO PURCHASED A GIFT FOR ME.  AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT THE CARD WAS STOLEN, I TRIED TO RETURN THE ITEM AND ONTACT THE CARDHOLDER TO NO AVAIL.  BEFORE I COULD EXPLAIN I WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AND CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR.""
