  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This was my wife's medical bill. She was also the one who received the papers. Because this bill was for her, and she took action to setup a payment plan to pay in full, she did not mention this to me.  She then left for Africa for six weeks as we are trying to adopt a child from there. It wasn't until she returned home and we were recapping our finances and budgets that I discovered this.  When I saw it, I knew that it needed to be disclosed and contacted our Compliance Department.""
