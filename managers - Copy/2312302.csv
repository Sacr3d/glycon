  ""Allegations"" : ""A FORMER CLIENT CLAIMS THAT A GROUP OF BONDS SOLD THROUGH OUR FIRM IN A \""DISCRETIONARY ACCOUNT\"" WERE SOLD SOLELY TO GENERATE COMMISSIONS.  THE CLIENT BELIEVES HE IS ENTITLED TO BE PAID BACK FOR REALIZED LOSSES ON THE BONDS AND THE ANNUAL INCOME THE BONDS PRODUCED.  THE CLIENT ALSO STATED THAT THE ACCOUNT WAS DISCRETIONARY IN NATURE. AS STATED IN OUR RESPONSE LETTER TO THE CLIENT AND HIS ATTORNEY, ALL OF THE CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT.  WE OFFERED STRAIGHTFORWARD, FACTUAL INFORMATION TO SUBSTANTIATE THIS.  SPECIFICALLY: 1.THE ACCOUNT IS NOT DISCRETIONARY, AND THE CLIENT AGREED TO ALL TRANSACTIONS BEFORE THEY TOOK PLACE. 2.OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE TO BRING THE CLIENT'S PORTFOLIO MORE IN LINE WITH HIS OBJECTIVES, AND HE UNDERSTOOD THIS AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTIONS.   3.THE BOND SALES WERE PART OF A RECOMMENDED RISK-REDUCTION AND LIQUIDITY ENHANCEMENT STRATEGY, WHICH HE AGREED TO.   4.THE BONDS (WHICH WERE VERY LONG-TERM MATURITIES) WERE REPLACED WITH SHORTER MATURITY BONDS.  THE NEW BONDS PROVIDED AN ANNUAL INCOME LEVEL SIMILAR TO THE ONES THEY REPLACED. 5.OUR STRATEGY REDUCED THE CLIENT'S ANNUAL FEES BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT, WHICH WOULD HAVE MORE THAN OFFSET THE COMMISSIONS PAID AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTIONS.   WE ALSO NOTED THAT THE CLIENT HID VITAL PLANNING INFORMATION FROM US, DESPITE OUR MULTIPLE REQUESTS TO OBTAIN IT.  WHILE THIS MAY NOT HAVE ALTERED THE TRANSACTIONS IN QUESTION, IT FURTHER SUBSTANTIATES OUR POSITION. FINALLY, IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE THAT SIX MONTHS AFTER THE TRANSACTIONS, BUT NEARLY TWO YEARS BEFORE THE CLAIM, OUR FIRM FIRED THIS CLIENT.  IT IS SOMETHING WE RARELY DO, BUT WE FELT HE WAS NOT ALLOWING US TO SERVICE HIM EFFECTIVELY.  IN DOING SO, WE CHOSE TO GIVE UP MANY YEARS OF REVENUE FROM THIS CLIENT, WHICH IS FURTHER PROOF THAT HIS CLAIMS ARE COMPLETELY WITHOUT MERIT."",
