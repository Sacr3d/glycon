UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, COMMON TRUST FUNDS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE DEFINITION OF \""INVESTMENT COMPANY\"" UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION PROVISIONS OF THE SECURITIES ACT. GENERALLY, THESE CONDITIONS ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT COMMON TRUST FUNDS ARE USED BY A BANK, IN ITS FIDUCIARY CAPACITY, SOLELY AS AN AID TO ADMINISTER ITS FIDUCIARY CLIENTS' ACCOUNTS AND NOT AS A SEPARATE INVESTMENT VEHICLE. HERE, THE RESPONDENTS USED A COMMON TRUST FUND AS A SEPARATE INVESTMENT VEHICLE FOR INVESTORS, MOST OF WHOM WERE NON-ACCREDITED INVESTORS, TO INVEST IN UNREGISTERED FUNDS OPERATED BY THE RESPONDENTS. THESE NON-ACCREDITED INVESTORS WERE ENTITLED TO THE INVESTOR PROTECTIONS PROVIDED BY THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND SECURITIES ACT, AND THE RESPONDENTS SHOULD HAVE REGISTERED THE COMMON TRUST FUND AND THE OFFERING OF THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY IT UNDER THOSE ACTS AND COMPLIED WITH THE REQUIREMENTS PERTAINING TO INVESTMENT COMPANIES UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. IN THIS CASE, THE RESPONDENTS ORGANIZED AND OPERATED THIRTEEN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THE RESPONDENTS MARKETED AND PUBLICLY OFFERED AND SOLD INTEREST IN THE FUNDS TO INVESTORS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO REGISTERED MUTUAL FUNDS. IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO AVOID THE REGULATORY AND REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND SECURITIES ACT, THE RESPONDENTS OFFERED DIFFERENT VEHICLES FOR INVESTING IN THE FUNDS. TO ACCREDITED INVESTORS, THE RESPONDENTS OFFERED AND SOLD DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN THE FUNDS. TO NON-ACCREDITED INVESTORS, THE RESPONDENTS OFFERED AND SOLD INDIRECT INVESTMENTS IN THE FUNDS  BY HAVING THE INVESTORS PLACE THEIR MONEY IN THE COMMON TRUST FUND. CONTINUED IN COMMENTS."",
