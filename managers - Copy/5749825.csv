MY OLDER BROTHER WHO I WAS CLOSE TO DIED IN 1991 AND WE BURIED HIM ON HIS 21ST BIRTHDAY. I WAS YOUNG AND NOT THINKING CLEARLY AFTER HIS DEATH AND WAS STILL GRIEVING.  THIS SENSELESS ACT STILL HAUNTS ME.  SINCE THE INCIDENT, I'VE BEEN A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY.  I'VE WORKED VERY HARD IN MY INSURANCE CAREER, BUILT GREAT CREDIT (NO BANKRUPTCIES, NO DUII'S,ETC...), AND CREATED A NICE LIFESTYLE FOR MY WIFE AND 2 YOUNG KIDS.  I ASK FOR A SECOND CHANCE IN BEING ABLE TO WORK IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR WITH AN APPROVED LICENSE.  I WILL ACT WITH THE UTMOST HONESTY AND INTEGRITY IN DEALING WITH FINANCIAL ISSUES FOR BOTH THE COMPANY AND MY CLIENTELE.  THANK YOU.""
