  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I have had an on going audit with the IRS since 2008 regarding an out side business. I have given all the information requested mutiple times and have had over all amount reduced and changed mutiple times. I have now opened up a request for a final audit in 2011 for tax years 2007-2009. I have had monies returned to me by the IRS at various times and await the final audit for the outside business. The IRS inquired about business expenses for the company over that time period and had deducted all the expenses for the business for all 3 years. I have now provided them all expens records and bank statments and recipts. I have request that this get expided to clear the judgment since the company did not have profits any where close to the amount that were aplied for in the judgment.""
