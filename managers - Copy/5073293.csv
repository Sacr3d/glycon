  ""Broker Comment"" : ""When we moved back to Houston, we leased a small apartment for the three of us.  Little did we know that a few months later, we would be taking legal custody of my niece and nephew.  Child Protective Services mandated that in order for us to taken in two additional children, we had to prove that we had adequate space for them.  Otherwise they would remain in State's custody.  This forced us to break our lease and move almost immediately.  We don't like to break our financial commitments, but in this case we had to make an exception.  I chose to settle the amount for $2,679.00.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In 1999, the date of this offense, I was a student at The University of Texas. As many college students who haven't been taught the importance of balancing a checkbook, I wrote a check (with intention of it clearing) and it bounced. In 1998 I assumed full legal custody of my two younger sisters. I have court papers to prove that I became their legal guardian- while still in college. Needless to say that during this time I was focused on gaining sufficient employment to provide for two additional mouths. Hence, I moved from Austin, TX to Plano, TX, and then to Houston, TX. Suffice it to say this offense was simply forgotten about until 2006.  In 2006 this offense caught up with me to my complete and utter surprise. This was not something I was intentionally dodging, but it was simply something that I had forgotten about some 7 years later considering everything I was dealing with. There was a court date, a fine was paid and I was told as a result this offense would be wiped from my record- as you see it was dismissed. So I continued along my professional career as such.  By that time (2006) I was already licensed in the financial industry and wanted to make sure this would not hinder me from maintaining my licenses. This is why I was deliberate in asking if this will be on my record. I was assured it wouldn't. Because of that I've conducted myself accordingly. I never intentionally hid nor gave any false information to cover up this offense.  My hope is that you see that this offense came about in a manner that most of us are familiar with- especially at college age. I bounced a check unintentionally. Because of how it's classified, \""Theft by check\"" I can understand why it would draw such attention. The fine that was paid to satisfy the offense assured me that this transgression would be wiped clean as if it never happened. In becoming employed with several other financial institutions since 2006, including VALIC, I safely concluded that what I was told was correct. Please note that this was not an act of withholding information, but rather an act of trusting what the judicial system told me. With Regards, Rodney S. Jones""
