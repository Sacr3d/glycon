  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Magill consented to the sanction and to the entry of findings that he participated in private investments away from his member firm to investors who were not customers of the firm, without first providing written notice to the firm. The findings stated that, while registered with his firm, Magill began working on behalf of a private issuer to find potential investors for a principal-protected note offered by the issuer. Magill recommended the note to investors, who invested a total of $700,000. Magill earned $14,000 in commissions, a bonus for securing investments, and the salary the private issuer paid him. Prior to recommending the note, Magill failed to conduct reasonable diligence to understand the features and risks of investing in the note. Later, Federal authorities shut down the private issuer's offices. An executive of the private issuer and Magill's supervisor at the private issuer both pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and were sentenced to prison. The investors lost their entire investment."",
