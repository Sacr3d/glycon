  ""Type"" : ""Bankruptcy"",
  ""Disposition"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I incurred a $14000 variable life commission charge back on a policy that I jointly wrote with a fellow rep. The policy was written on the joint rep so that he could be credited points to qualify for a company trip. Once his trip was satisfied he surrendered the policy creating the charge back. This charge back impacted my monthly income and fell behind on mortgage payments and other non-secured debt. Eventually I was unable to catch up resulting in foreclosure and other litigation. To stave off these proceedings I filed Chapter 13 protection. Current status is I am current and in compliance with my plan and am aying my required amount to the trustee of $1620 per month. Final Disposition was 1/06/2017""
