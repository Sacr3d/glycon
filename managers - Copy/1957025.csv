  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MYSELF AND FOUR OTHERS (AGES 18-19) WERE ACCUSED OF RAPE BY THE PLAINTIFF`S FATHER.  IN A CLOSED HEARING THIS CHARGE WAS REDUCED, AS NOTED ABOVE.  AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE CHARGE OF CONTRIBUTING TO THE DELINQUENCY OF A MINOR WAS IMPOSED BECAUSE THE DEFENDENTS WERE OVER EIGHTEEN AND THE PLAINTIFF WAS UNDER EIGHTEEN (16 OR 17). UNTIL MID 1988 I WAS UNAWARE THAT THE INITIAL FELONY CHARGE WAS PART OF MY PERMANENT RECORD.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE A DISCLOSABLE EVENT.""
