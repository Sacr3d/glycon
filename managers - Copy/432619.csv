  ""Allegations"" : ""CLIENT CLAIMS HE BECAME CONCERNED WITH HIS PUTNAM VOYAGER FUND AND WAS ADVISED TO STAY THE COURSE BY THE IR.  AS THE VALUE CONTINUED TO DROP, CLIENT CLAIMS HE EXCHANGED THE FUND TO THE PUTNAM MONEY MARKET FUND.  CLIENT CLAIMS THE IR \""RIDICULED\"" HIM, STATING THINGS LOOKED GOOD AND THE VALUE WOULD CONTINUE TO APPRECIATE.  CLIENT CLAIMS, AS A RESULT, HE MOVED THE FUNDS BACK TO THE PUTNAM VOYAGER FUND.  CLIENT CLAIMS THE VALUE CONTINUED TO DROP.  CLIENT CLAIMS HE LATER LEARNED ABOUT THE REVENUE SHARING BETWEEN PUTNAM AND EDWARD JONES AND THAT NONE OF THIS WAS EVER DISCLOSED TO CLIENT BY THE IR.  CLIENT CLAIMS \""CASH AND BENEFITS\"" TO EDWARD JONES IRS HAVE COLORED THE ADVICE BEING GIVEN TO THE CLIENT.

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CLIENT REQUESTED THE EXCHANGE FROM VOYAGER TO MONEY MARKET ON MAY 25, 1999, DIRECTLY WITH THE FUND COMPANY.  AT THAT TIME, THE FUNDS WERE VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $46,000.  IR STATED HE HAD PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED THE FUND WITH CLIENT AND HAD ADVISED CLIENT TO STAY INVESTED IN VOYAGER.  CLIENT EXCHANGED THE FUNDS BACK TO VOYAGER ON NOVEMBER 11, 1999, AND THE SHARE VALUE CONTINUED TO INCREASE UNTIL EARLY 2001.  CLIENT ALSO APPEARS TO HAVE ADDED TO THE FUND DIRECTLY THROUGH THE FUND COMPANY.  WHILE WE UNDERSTAND CLIENT'S DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE OF FUND, IT DOES APPEAR THE DECLINE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO MARKET FLUCTUATION.  IR STATED HE DID PROVIDE CLIENT WITH PROSPECTUS AT TIME OF PURCHASE AND CLIENT WAS PROVIDED WITH CUSTOMER STATEMENTS WHICH SET OUT THE INVESTMENTS IN CLIENT'S ACCOUNT, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATED CURRENT VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS.  THE FIRM CONTINUES TO BELIEVE MUTUAL FUNDS ARE GOOD INVESTMENTS FOR MANY LONG-TERM INVESTORS AND OFFER DIVERSIFICATION AS WELL AS PROFESSIONAL FUND MANAGERS AND HAVE HISTORICALLY PERFORMED WELL.  IT IS OUR OPINION THE ACTIVITY IN CLIENT'S ACCOUNT WAS EFFECTED WITH CLIENT'S INFORMED KNOWLEDGE AND AUTHORIZATION AND NO ADJUSTMENT WILL BE MADE TO CLIENT'S ACCOUNT AS A RESULT OF THE DECLINE IN VALUE OF THE PUTNAM VOYAGER FUND.
