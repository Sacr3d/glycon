  ""Broker Comment"" : ""WITH REGARDS TO THE CUSTOMER COMPLAINT SUBMITTED BY [CUSTOMER], I FIND IT UNFOUNDED AND WITHOUT MERIT.  WE ([THIRD PARTY] & MYSELF) ACTED PRUDENTLY AND TAX-CONSCIOUSLY WHEN ADVISING HER ON HER ACCOUNT IN LINE WITH HER FINANCIAL GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND RISK TOLERANCE WHICH WE DEVELOPED IN THE THOROUGH PROCESS OF FINANCIAL PLANNING.  WE ATTEMPTED TO WORK WITH HER INHERITANCE WHICH WAS ALL EQUITY TO GIVE HER THE CASH FLOW AND ON-DEMAND CASH THAT SHE WANTED WHILE WARNING HER OF THE TAX RAMIFICATIONS OF ANY WHOLESALE SELLING OR TRANSITIONING IN HER ACCOUNT.  THOUGH HAVING A ROUGH MARKET IN 2000-2001, WE WERE ABLE TO DELIVER A POSITIVE RETURN AND CONTAINED THE TAX DAMAGE TO A MINIMUM AS LONG AS WE WERE MANAGING THE PROCESS.  THAT ENDED DUE TO HER DEMANDING MORE TECHNOLOGY IN HER PORTFOLIO AND HER IGNORING THE WARNINGS OF TAX IMPLICATIONS IF SHE PROCEEDED WITH HER DIRECTION. THROUGH THIS WE STILL KEPT HER FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE AND WERE ABLE TO HOLD ON TO A POSITIVE RETURN SINCE ACCOUNT INCEPTION.  WHEN TRANSACTIONS WERE INITIATED, THEY WERE FULLY DISCUSSED TO AMOUNT TO BE INVESTED, STOCKS TO BE SELECTED, AND ACTUAL SHARE NUMBERS WERE ALWAYS GIVEN TO HER THROUGH CONFIRMATIONS AND STATEMENTS.  AT NO TIME DID SHE EVER COMPLAIN OR ASK FOR VERBAL SHARE AMOUNTS AFTER EACH TRADE.  AS FOR INAPPROPRIATE STOCKS IN HER PORTFOLIO, WE KEPT HER MORE CONSERVATIVE THEN HER DEMAND FOR THE DOT COMS OF THE INVESTMENT WORLD.  THIS COMPLAINT IS THE RESULT OF AN ATTORNEY WHO CONVINCED [CUSTOMER] THAT SHE HAD A \""CASE\"" AND SUBMITTED THE COMPLAINT WITHOUT DOING HIS HOMEWORK, EVEN THOUGH WE DELIVERED ALL STATEMENTS TO HIS PERSON.  THE NUMBERS ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE REALITY AND DISREGARD THE NEARLY $300,000 THAT SHE TOOK FROM THIS ACCOUNT IN WITHDRAWALS OVER THE TIMESPAN PREVIOUSLY STATED.  $856,156.89 IN / $299,854.29 OUT BECAUSE OF HER WITHDRAWALS / AND $628,967.40 THROUGH TRANSFER TO ANOTHER FIRM.  IF YOU DO THE MATH, THAT IS $72,664.80 OF GROWTH THAT SHE GOT OVER THE TIME PERIOD.""
