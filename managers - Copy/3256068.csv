  ""Broker Comment"" : ""OUR REVIEW FOUND THE ADVISOR PROVIDED POLICY ILLUSTRATIONS TO THE CLIENTS WHICH CLEARLY DETAILED SURRENDER CHARGES AND MINIMUM NO LAPSE PREMIUM AMOUNTS. THE ILLUSTRATIONS ALSO SHOWED A HYPOTHETICAL POLICY VALUES BASED ON 0% AND 11% RETURNS. THE CLIENTS SIGNED AND DATED THE ILLUSTRATIONS. BASED ON THIS INFORMATION, WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEIR CLAIM THAT THEY DID NOT RECEIVE FULL AND FAIR DISCLOSURE REGARDING POLICY FEATURES. THE CLIENTS COULD HAVE MAINTAINED COVERAGE WITH REDUCED PREMIUMS, BUT THEY OPTED TO CANCEL THE POLICIES INSTEAD. FINALLY, THE CLIENTS MISTAKENLY BELIEVED THEY COULD NOT RECEIVE DISABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE IN ADDITION TO THEIR POLICIES THROUGH WORK.""
