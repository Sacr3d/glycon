  ""Broker Comment"" : ""SCHOLZ WAS DISCHARGED BY MERRILL LYNCH AND HE DOES NOT ACCEPT THE REASON FOR THAT DISCHARGE. THE NYSE REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM SCHOLZ REGARDING THE HANDLING OF ONE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTS WHICH HE SERVICED AT MERRILL LYNCH. NO CHARGES OR ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST HIM. THE REASON SCHOLZ WAS DISCHARGED FROM MERRILL LYNCH WAS BECAUSE \""HE FAILED TO LEARN ESSENTIAL FACTS ABOUT ONE OF HIS CLIENT'S ACCOUNTS, THEREBY EXPOSING THE FIRM TO A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL LOSS.\"" WITH RESPECT TO SCHOLZ'S NEGATIVE ANSWER TO ITEM 29C; SCHOLZ IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF ANY INVESTIGATION OR PROCEEDING. HE DID RECEIVE A LETTER INQUIRY FORM THE NYSE, WHICH HE ANSWERED. SINCE THAT TIME THERE HAS BEEN NO FURTHER COMMUNICATION FROM THE STOCK EXCHANGE OR ANY OTHER ENTITY ON THE MATTER.
