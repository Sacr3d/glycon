  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I STARTED HAVING TO PAY MY RENT AND MY ROOMMATED WHICH BACKED UP ALL MY BILLS. I RECEIVED A SUMMONS AND WENT TO COURT AND I MET WITH A REPRESENTATIVE FROM CITIFINACIAL. WE SAT DOWN AND WENT OVER THE SITUATION AND WE DISCUSSED MY FINANCIAL SITUATION TO MAKE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS. I SHOWED HIM ALL THE BILLS I WAS PAYING AT THE TIME AND HE DECIDED TO GET BACK TO ME AT ANOTHER TIME TO SEE IF MY FINANCIAL SITUATION HAD CHANGED. SHORTLY AFTER I MET WITH HIM, I BECAME UNEMPLOYED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HIM SINCE THEN. HOWEVER, I WILL BE CONTACTING THEM TO SET UP A PAYMENT PLAN TO REPAY MY DEBT NOW THAT MY SITUATION HAS CHANGED.""
