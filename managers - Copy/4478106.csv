  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In my role as a pseudo manager for the Miami-Dade and Broward School accounts, I was managing client contacts and representative accountability.  In order to have the representative listed as the agent of record, standard practice is to submit a Change of Agent form which includes the client social security number, address, date of birth, phone number and signature.  In all cases this information was provided by the MetLife proprietary information I was given.  The representative would then have the client sign and the form was faxed into MetLife.  In all of the reassignment situations there was not an active representative assigned to the orphaned client.  However, not all of the reassignments were triggered from the client.  Some were done as they were identified as being \""orphaned.\""    The client signature verbiage on the U5 report is the result of a client being reassigned without prior knowledge of the change.  Client called to question the new representative listed on their quarterly statement.  I received a Change of Agent form without the client signature.  I was being hasty and disregarded what I know to be the only acceptable business practice.  I should have rejected the form and sent it back to the client for signature.  I did not.  I faxed the Change of Agent Form to MetLife with a signature.""
