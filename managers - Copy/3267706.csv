  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I DID ADVISE THE RETIRED CUSTOMER OF THE PROTECTION CLAUSE ON THE MET LIFE VARIABLE ANNUITY IN 2007, BUT THE CUSTOMER WAS ANGRY WITH THE MET LIFE  AGENT WHO SOLD THE VARIABLE ANNUITY, THAT LOST 20 %. AND THE MET LIFE AGENT WAS NOT RETURNING HER PHONE CALLS AND SO SHE WANTED OUT OF MET LIFE. TWO YEARS AFTER THE SALE, IN 2009, THE CUSTOMER' SENT A COMPLAINT LETTER TO BANKERS LIFE AND WAS SETTLED FOR A FULL REFUND OF $5358  THAT WAS PAID TO THE CUSTOMER. FOUR YEARS LATER, IN 2013, THE NJ DOI REOPENED THE CASE INVOLVING THE PROTECTION CLAUSE AND SCHEDULED A HEARING. BANKERS LIFE WOULD NOT GIVE ME THE FILE BECAUSE I WAS NO LONGER AN EMPLOYEE. THEREFORE, WITHOUT THE FILE, COUPLED WITH THE COST OF RETAINING AN ATTORNEY WHICH WOULD BE DOUBLE THE STATE DOI FINE, I DECIDED TO PAY THE FINE OUT OF COURT. THE FINE WAS PAID OFF IN INSTALLMENTS ENTIRELY WITHIN 6 MONTHS.""
