PALLO RECOMMENDED AND EFFECTED THE PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY $688,000.00 IN MUTUAL FUND CLASS B SHARES IN THE ACCOUNT OF CUSTOMERS, WITHOUT HAVING REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS WERE SUITABLE FOR THE CUSTOMERS IN VIEW OF THE AMOUNT OF CLASS B SHARES PURCHASED AND NATURE OF THE RECOMMENDED TRANSACTIONS, AND IN LIGHT OF THE CUSTOMERS FINANCIAL SITUATION, INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, CIRCUMSTANCES, AND NEEDS.  RESPONDENT'S RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE ACCOUNTS WERE UNSUITABLE IN THAT HE SHOULD HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT THE CUSTOMERS PURCHASE CLASS A MUTUAL FUND SHARES GIVEN THE AMOUNT INVESTED.  HAD CLASS A SHARES BEEN RECOMMENDED INSTEAD OF CLASS B SHARES, THESE CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE: (1) BEEN ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE BREAKPOINTS ON CLASS A SHARE PURCHASES; (2) PAID LOWER 12B-1 FEES; AND (3) AVOIDED BEING SUBJECT TO CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGES.  RESPONDENT RECOMMENDED AND EFFECTED UNSUITABLE MUTUAL FUND SWITCH TRANSACTIONS IN THE ACCOUNT OF A CUSTOMER, WITHOUT HAVING REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS WERE SUITABLE FOR THE CUSTOMER IN VIEW OF THE NATURE OF THE RECOMMENDED TRANSACTIONS, AND IN LIGHT OF THE CUSTOMERS FINANCIAL SITUATION, INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, CIRCUMSTANCES, AND NEEDS.  RESPONDENT RECOMMENDED THAT THE CUSTOMER SELL TWO CLASS A MUTUAL FUNDS AND PURCHASE AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF CLASS A MUTUAL FUND SHARES THE FOLLOWING DAY.  THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE UNSUITABLE IN THAT THE CUSTOMER INCURRED UNNECESSARY EXPENSES BECAUSE THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES OF THE CLASS A  SHARES THAT WERE SOLD WERE NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE CLASS A SHARES THAT WERE PURCHASED. AS A RESULT OF THE SWITCHES, THE CUSTOMER PAID A FRONT-END SALES LOAD OF APPROXIMATELY $7,200.00, WHICH WAS PAID TO RESPONDENT AS COMMISSION FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS."",
