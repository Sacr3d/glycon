  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Kempson consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he effected 40 unauthorized trades in a deceased customer's accounts. The findings stated that although Kempson was aware of the customer's death, he did not inform his member firm of the customer's death and continued to effect trades on a discretionary basis in the customer's accounts. At the time the customer opened the accounts, the customer signed an agreement with the firm granting Kempson discretionary trading authority over the accounts. However, after the customer died, Kempson had no written authority to conduct any trades in the customer's accounts."",
