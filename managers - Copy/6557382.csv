  ""Broker Comment"" : ""A friend of mine had given me a prescription bottle of a sleep aid called Ambian,\"" a controlled substance\"" there was 2 pills remaining in the bottle and had told me to try them and if they worked for me to ask my Dr. about obtaining it for my sleeping disorder. When I went to my Dr. apt, I was asking my Dr. about getting this medication, I showed him the bottle trying to explain what medication I wanted and that my friend had given this to me to try and ask him about.  I wasn't aware that the prescription was a controlled substance or even if I had known that, that trying the prescription and also having her script bottle was illegal. The Dr. however didn't tell me this either and after I left my appointment he reported it.  Initially I was called in for questioning and was under suspicion that I had obtained the prescription by theft or deceit, this was where they originally charged me with the felony but before we went to court and I plead they \""AMENDED\"" the charge to the possession, as I did not obtain the prescription by theft or deceit, but I was in possession of a controlled substance not prescribed in my name, and admitted to taking 2 of the medications. This is what my attorney told me, he told me that I wasn't making a plea down, that The charges were Amended and there would be no felony record, so I am very confused with this whole situation. When I went to the court to obtain the attached documents I was advised by the clerk that from what they saw my record shouldn't even reflect the original \""felony\"" charge as it was amended not a plea, meaning they change it on their accord. The Clerk stated there is an error on the paper work on page 2 where it shows the status as Active, and this is probably why the correct changes weren't made to the original charge and removed from the record.""
