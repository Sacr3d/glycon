  ""Broker Comment"" : ""[REDACTED] was a longtime client. Overall there was no loss in her account. We talked reasonably and seemed she was fine with her investment results.   I strongly disagree with the allegation of recommending unsuitable investments. This client expressed a need for a consistent income stream from her investments. Through regular meetings and discussions over the years, she was aware of and agreed to all holdings in her accounts, and she did not express any concerns regarding suitability during this time. Though she has taken a number of substantial unscheduled withdrawals, at the time of this complaint, her overall account performance was positive.""
