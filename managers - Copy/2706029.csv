  ""Broker Comment"" : ""NOT ONLY DID THE CLIENT SIGN DISCLOSURE, TRANSFER AND ANNUITY REPLACEMENT QUESTIONNAIRE PAPERWORK TO MOVE FROM A FIXED ANNUITY TO A VARIABLE ANNUITY. HE ALSO SIGNED THE POLICY DELIVERY RECEIPT FOR THE ACCOUNTS UPON DELIVERY OF POLICIES. HE RECEIVED QUARTERLY STATEMENTS FROM METLIFE WHICH STATES CLEARLY THAT IT IS AN ANNUITY WHICH WE REVIEWED REGULARLY. HE ALSO SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED ANNUAL STATEMENTS.  THE CLIENT NEVER EXPRESSED TO ME HIS DESIRE FOR MUTUAL FUNDS IN STEAD OF ANNUITY BECAUSE HE HAD EQUITABLE AND TIAA ANNUITY THAT WE TRANSFERRED TO THEIR IRA'S. THE THREE (3) NON-QUALIFIED ACCOUNTS THAT WE OPENED FOR THEM HE WANTED THE TAX DEFERRAL THAT ONLY AN ANNUITY OFFERS. HAVING THAT DISCUSSION I WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE KNEW WE WERE PUTTING THE MONEY IN AN ANNUITY.  THE CLIENT IS ALSO A LAWYER WITH GOOD INVESTMENT KNOWLEDGE.  MOST RECENTLY ON 4-5-07 I RECOMMENDED TO HIM THE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON MUTUAL FUNDS FOR HIS 403B BUT HE WANTED TO STAY WHERE HE WAS AT BECAUSE OF THE HIGH FRONT END COST OF 5%.""
