  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I was a registered representative at Morgan Stanley from 2005-2019.  The advisor I had worked for since joining the firm informed me in 2018 that he was planning to retire from Morgan Stanley under the upcoming enhanced 2019 Morgan Stanley Former Advisor Retirement Program.  After mentioning that I would seek to start a new chapter outside Morgan Stanley, the management team requested that I stay on and help them in transitioning the client base to other advisors.  Over time, questions had come up regarding the potential sharing of team members' log-in credentials, but there was never a concern about client involvement or any client impact.  Morgan Stanley asked that I help them diligently over a period of months to effect a smooth transition of clients to the new advisors located in various states.  My transition efforts were so successful that they requested I stay longer to continue to provide historical knowledge, assist during the busy tax season and complete the quarter-end client reviews.  I was consistently commended on not only my contributions to the firm, but my service and dedication to clients during my tenure.  At the end of the extended period, I left Morgan Stanley and joined First Manhattan Co. without having been advised of any issues relating to the U-5 termination filing.""
