  ""Allegations"" : ""WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, TIBBS CONSENTED TO THE SANCTION AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT HE MISREPRESENTED TO HIS MEMBER FIRM THAT HE SCORED 68% AND 71% ON TWO SEPARATE ATTEMPTS AT THE SERIES 66 EXAMINATION. HIS ACTUAL SCORES WERE 28% AND 58%. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT SINCE TIBBS' FIRM BELIEVED THAT HE WAS CLOSE TO PASSING THE EXAM, TIBBS AND HIS MANAGER DISCUSSED A POSSIBLE EXTENSION OF THE FIRM'S 120 DAY PERIOD REQUIRED TO PASS THE SERIES 66 EXAMINATION. THE SERIES 66 EXAMINATION REQUIRES A SCORE OF 75% OR HIGHER TO PASS. TIBBS' SUPERVISOR REQUESTED THAT TIBBS PROVIDE DOCUMENTS TO HIS FIRM REFLECTING HIS SERIES 66 EXAMINATION TEST SCORES. TIBBS PROVIDED FALSIFIED DOCUMENTS TO THE FIRM REFLECTING THE INCORRECT SCORES OF 68% AND 71% THAT HE HAD VERBALLY REPORTED TO THE FIRM."",
