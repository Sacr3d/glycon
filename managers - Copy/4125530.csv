  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I ANSWERED NO TO QUESTION 23A(1)(B) BECAUSE I BELIEVED THAT THESE CHARGES HAD BEEN EXPUNGED FROM MY RECORD.  ON MARCH 25, 1994, MY THEN HUSBAND TOOK MY SON FROM SCHOOL WITHOUT MY CONSENT AND FILED FOR A DIVORCE THE SAME DAY.  WE HAD BEEN SEPARATED FOR FIVE YEARS AND I HAD BEEN MY SON'S ONLY PROVIDER.  IN THE STATE OF MISSOURI A PARENT DOES NOT HAVE LEGAL CUSTODY OF A CHILD UNTIL A LEGAL SEPARATION HAS BEEN FILED, THIS I DID NOT KNOW. UPON FILING FOR A DIVORCE AND CLAIMING CUSTODY OF MY SON, MY EX-HUSBAND BECAME HIS LEGAL GUARDIAN.  WITH THE HELP OF MY ATTORNEY, I OBTAINED VISITATION TO SEE MY CHILD ON APRIL 17, 1994, THREE WEEKS AFTER HIS FATHER HAD TAKEN HIM.  WHILE VISITING WITH MY SON, HE ASKED TO BE TAKEN HOME AND THAT HIS FATHER WAS ABUSING HIM.  AT THIS POINT, I MADE THE DECISION TO TAKE HIM HOME WITH ME.  WHICH OF COURSE LATER I WAS ARRESTED, DETAINED, AND CHARGED WITH PARENTAL KIDNAPPING AND 2ND DEGREE ASSAULT.  THESE CHARGES WERE DISMISSED BECAUSE I HAD DOCUMENTATION SUPPORTING THE FACT THAT I HAD BEEN THIS CHILD'S GUARDIAN HIS ENTIRE LIFE AND THE CHARGE OF 2ND DEGREE ASSAULT WAS DROPPED BECAUSE I DIDN'T ASSAULT HIM IN WAY SHAPE OR FORM.  IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CHARGES HAD BEEN EXPUNGED AND WERE \""NON-EXISTENT\"" IF YOU WILL.  I WAS GRANTED FULL CUSTODY OF MY SON AT THE DIVORCE HEARING.  LATER MY SECOND AND PRESENT HUSBAND ADOPTED OUR SON.""
