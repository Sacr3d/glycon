I was not satisfied with accountants' help/advice or progress so I contacted the IRS directly explaining the discrepancies. I entered into an installment agreement to demonstrate willingness to pay while we resolved the discrepancies. In our discussions with prior tax accountants and with various IRS representatives we were advised that the amounts and the liens were inappropriately filed thus our \""no\"" response to question 14 of the U4 DRP. The IRS has removed earlier liens filed in a similar fashion and we are working with them to resolve the remaining liens.""
