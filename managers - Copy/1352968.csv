  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ALTHOUGH ASSOCIATED WITH D.A. CAMPBELL COMPANY, INC. (THE \""FIRM\"") AS GEN. SECURITIES PRINCIPAL AND FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONS PRINCIPAL,CAROL OLSON'S DUTIES AT THE TIME OF THE VIOLATION RELATED PRIMARILY TO SUPERVISION OF THE FIRM'S ACCOUNTING DEPT. MS. OLSON DID NOT HAVE ANY AUTHORITY OVER THE FIRM'S SALES OR TRADING DEPARTMENTS, AND HAVE VERY LIMITED AUTHORITY OVER THE FIRM'S OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT. THE FIRM OPERATES UNDER THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED BY SEC RULE 15C3-3 (K) (2) (I), AND TRADES SOLELY WITH INSTITUIONAL CLIENTS AND BROKERS ON RVP/DVP BASIS.  THE FIRM'S TRADING CONSISTS OF ARBITRAGE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO AND RISKLESS PRINCIPAL TRADING. THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT NET CAPITAL,IN CONTRAVENTION OF SEC RULE 15C3-1, WAS THE RESULT OF UNSUALLY HIGH TRADING VOLUME DURING THE TWO BUSINESS DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO REPORTING,COUPLED WITH UNUSUALLY HIGH HAIRCUTS ON THE SECURITIES TRADED.  REPORTING ON TRADE DATE BASIS, THE HIGH LEVEL OF TRADING RESULTED IN SUBSTANTIAL AGGREGATE INDEBTEDNESS RELATED TO FULLY SECURED TRADES DUE TO SETTLE IN THE FUTURE. THE FIRM HAS MAINTAINED SUFFICIENT NET CAPITAL SINCE THE DATA OF THE VIOLATION DISCUSSED ABOVE AND HAD NOT BEEN IN VIOLATION PRIOR TO SUCH OCCURRENCE DURING MS. OLSON'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE FIRM AS FINANCIAL PRINCIPAL. AFTER THE VIOLATION, THE FIRM SUBMITTED WEEKLY NET CAPITAL CALCULATIONS TO THE NASD.  EACH SUCH CALCULATION SHOWED THE FIRM TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH SEC RULE 15C3-1.""
