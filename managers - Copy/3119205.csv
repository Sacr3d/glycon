  ""Disposition"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I TOOK OUT A SECOND MORTGAGE ON MY HOME IN 2007 TO START AN ALLSTATE AGENCY FROM SCRATCH.  IN 2008 I BOUGHT A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY FOR THE BUSINESS WITH LOANS FROM THE SAME BANK.  IN LATE 2008 THE BUSINESS SUFFERED SOME SEVERE SETBACKS AND I GOT BEHIND IN THE LOAN PAYMENTS.  I TRIED TO WORK OUT A MODIFICATION WITH THE BANK BUT THEY WERE VERY UNREASONABLE.  IN 2010 I STARTED A NEW INDEPENDENT AGENCY, CLOSED THE ALLSTATE AGENCY AND PUT THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY UP FOR SALE, BUT WAS UNABLE TO FIND A BUYER BEFORE THE BANK FORECLOSED.  I FILED THE CHAPTER 13 TO PREVENT THE BANK FROM FORCING ME OUT OF MY HOME.  A DETAILED LETTER OF EXPLANATION HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO MY FIRM, THE O.N. EQUITY SALES COMPANY.""
