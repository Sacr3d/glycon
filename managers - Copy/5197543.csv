  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Perry consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings, that she engaged in conduct that caused her member firm to create and maintain inaccurate books and records. The findings stated that Perry obtained a signed, but otherwise blank, portfolio loan account (PLA) disbursement request form (the \""master disbursement request\"") from her firm's customer. Perry used the master disbursement request each time the customer requested a disbursement from her PLA. At times, Perry also signed or reused the signature of the firm's representative assigned to the customer's account to complete the disbursement request. The customer was aware that Perry was reusing the master disbursement request and authorized each of the transactions. Perry repeated this conduct of using falsified signatures on disbursement requests for two other firm customers. These customers were not aware that Perry was reusing their signatures, but had requested and authorized each of the transactions."",
