I was not functioning in the capacity of a financial advisor as of June of 2000 and was not licensed until 2004. I did not solicit any securities nor did I sell any investment products to this client at any time. According to Chase Investment Services Corp I was listed LATER as a servicing agent, along with other Reps that worked in that office at the time. The Compliant was deemed to be without merit and was subsequently denied. A petition for removal/amendment from my U-4 has been submitted to FINRA.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This complaint was directed and submitted towards the licensed associate who at that time was employed as my Licensed Financial Assistant at Wamu Investments. Under Wamu Investments policy/guidelines she was able to solicit and sell securities using my rep code. This contract was solicited and sold to the client by my licensed financial assistant using my rep code. I did not solicit nor did I sell any investment products to this client. I had nothing to do with the solicitation of the initial trade. I had met with the client approximately a year later when he came in asking for his 5% interest. My assistant had since been promoted to Financial Advisor in another office with Chase Investments. With her being absent, I tried to re-explain the contract to the clients understanding but was unsuccessful. Client repeatedly stated that since I was not present at the initial presentation that I did not know how it was presented to him and the explanation given by the other rep was misleading. Chase Investment Services Corp reported the complaint to Finra under both our names/U-4's. (Please refer to CRD #5013130) A petition for removal from my U-4 is been submitted to Finra based on these special circumstance.""
