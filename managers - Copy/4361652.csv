  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ON 10/18/96 I WAS ATTENDING COLLEGE ON LONG ISLAND, NY. THAT EVENING MY ROOMMATE AND A GROUP OF FRIENDS INCLUDING MYSELF WERE DROPPED OFF AT AN OFF-CAMPUS PARTY. AFTER THE PARTY WE WERE OFFERED A RIDE BACK TO CAMPUS FROM A FEMALE ACQUAINTANCE OF MY ROOMMATE. WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE CAR THE FEMALE NOTICED THAT THE CAR ANTENNA WAS BROKEN AND HANGING OFF THE SIDE OF THE CAR. AT THIS POINT SHE WAS UPSET AND STARTING GETTING INAPPROPRIATELY ANGRY. AS WE WERE DRIVING BACK TO CAMPUS, ONE OF THE PASSENGERS ACCIDENTALLY DAMAGED THE CEILING OF THE CAR WITH A LIT CIGARETTE. SHE PULLED THE CAR OVER AND AGAIN BECAME ANGRY AND TOLD US TO WALK HOME. THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CIGARETTE BURN APOLOGIZED AND TOLD HER HE WOULD PAY FOR IT. EARLY THE NEXT MORNING (10/19/1996)CAMPUS SECURITY KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND SAID THAT THE NASSAU COUNTY POLICE WANTED TO ASK US SOME QUESTIONS REGARDING DAMAGE TO A FEMALES VEHICLE. AFTER THEY QUESTIONED US FOR A WHILE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE CONTRADICTORY STORIES REGARDING THE INCIDENT. THEY PROCEEDED TO CHARGE US FOR THE DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE, WHICH THEY CLAIMED, WAS IN EXCESS OF $1,000.00 PROMPTING A FELONY CHARGE. AT THE COURTHOUSE THAT MORNING I WAS RELEASED WITHOUT BAIL AND RETURNED BACK TO CAMPUS. WHEN WE RETURNED FOR MY FIRST COURT APPEARANCE IT WAS POSTPONED BECAUSE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY COULD NOT CONTACT THE PLAINTIFF. AFTER THANKSGIVING RECESS I RETURNED TO COURT AGAIN AND THE HEARING WAS POSTPONED FOR THE SAME REASONS. WHEN I RETURNED ON 1/09/1997 TO DEAL WITH THE CASE PERTAINING TO DOCKET # 32380/96 I WAS INFORMED THE COURT THAT THE PLAINTIFF WAS BEING DETAINED IN A [REDACTED) CENTER IN DELAWARE FOLLOWING AN ARREST FOR CREDIT CARD FRAUD. THE JUDGE RECOMMENDED TO MY ATTORNEY THAT I PLEAD GUILTY TO A VIOLATION IN ORDER TO COVER COURT COSTS IN THIS MATTER. I PLEAD GUILTY TO A VIOLATION UNDER NY PENAL CODE 240.20 DISORDERLY CONDUCT AND PAID A $100.00 FINE FOR THIS MATTER. ""
