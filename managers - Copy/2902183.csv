  ""Firm Name"" : ""FIDELITY BROKERAGE SERVICES LLC"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""FIRM DETERMINED EMPLOYEE VIOLATED CORPORATE TRAVEL AND EXPENSE POLICY."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I AM WRITING IN RESPONSE TO THE ALLEGATION ON MY U4. I DO NOT BELIEVE I VIOLATED THE FIRM'S CORPORATE TRAVEL AND EXPENSE POLICY.  DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS, I TRAVELED NEARLY EVERY DAY ON FIRM BUSINESS THROUGHOUT FLORIDA, GEORGIA, ALABAMA, AND TENNESSEE.  CONTEMPORANEOUSLY AFTER EXPENSES WERE INCURRED, EACH WAS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY A FIRM SUPERVISOR AND YET ANOTHER FIRM EMPLOYEE BEFORE BEING REIMBURSED.  TO MY SURPRISE, ON MY LAST DAY OF EMPLOYMENT, JULY 19TH, 2012 THE FIRM SOUGHT TO CALL INTO QUESTION SEVERAL PREVIOUSLY APPROVED EXPENSES FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.  I WAS NOT GIVEN WARNING OR AFFORDED A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THE FIRM'S ALLEGATIONS.  THE FIRM APPARENTLY SOUGHT TO UNILATERALLY OVERRULE YEARS-OLD SUPERVISORY APPROVALS OF EXPENSES AS THE BASIS TO TERMINATE OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.  I BELIEVE IT IS UNFAIR THAT THE FIRM HAS PLACED THESE ALLEGATIONS ON MY U-4 REPORT AND I HAVE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED THAT THESE UNPROVEN ALLEGATIONS BE REMOVED.  IN CONCLUSION, THE FIRM AND I HAD A DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT CONSTITUTED REASONABLE BUSINESS EXPENSES AND THEY MADE A DECISION TO TERMINATE MY EMPLOYMENT. I WAS DEEPLY SADDENED AND HEART BROKEN BY THE DECISION. THE DISMISSAL CAME AFTER SIX AND A HALF YEARS OF TENURE AT THE FIRM WHERE I WORKED TIRELESSLY TO ACHIEVE RESULTS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL AND AS SUCH I RECEIVED ACCOLADES FOR MY PERFORMANCE, WHICH FAR EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS.  FURTHERMORE, AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF LONG INVESTIGATION FINRA FOUND THAT NO STATUTE OR CODE OF CONDUCT WAS VIOLATED AND SENT ME A LETTER STATING THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETE AND THE MATTER WAS OFFICIALLY CLOSED WITH NO CORRECTIVE ACTION.""
