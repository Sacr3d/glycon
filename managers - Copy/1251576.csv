  ""Broker Comment"" : ""*IN APRIL OF 1984, MY SECOND WEEK AS A LICENSED REGISTERED REP, MY FIRM ADVERTISED A BOND IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. A CALL FROM IOWA CAME IN AND WAS ROUTED TO ME. WE HAD APPLIED FOR, BUT NOT RECEIVED IOWA APPROVAL OF MY LICENSE. I ASKED MY COMPLIANCE OFFICER WHAT I SHOULD DO. HE SAID TO GO AHEAD WITH THE SALE AND INSURED ME THAT SINCE WE HAD SUBMITTED MY REGISTRAGION TO THE STATE OF IOWA, I COULD CONDUCT BUSINESS IN THE STATE. I SOLD $2,000 WORTH OF BONDS. THREE DAYS AFTER THIS SALE MY IOWA REGISTRATION WAS APPROVED. ONE YEAR LATER THE IOWA NASD AUDITED MY FIRM AND DISCOVERED THAT THIS SALE OCCURRED WHILE MY REGISTRATION WITH IOWA WAS PENDING. I WAS FINED $50 AND SIGNED A NEITHER ADMIT OR DENY LETTER.""
