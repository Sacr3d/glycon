  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I HAD A RENTAL CAR FOR A PERIOD OF 2 MONTHS WHILE MY CAR WAS IN THE REPAIR SHOP.  EVEN THOUGH MONEY WAS BEING DEBITED FROM MY BANKCARD TO COVER THE CHARGES OF THE RENTAL, THE RENTAL CAR COMPANY FILED CHARGES AS THEY STATE THAT I NEEDED TO COME IN AFTER 30 DAYS AND SIGN A NEW RENTAL AGREEMENT.  THERE WERE NO ATTEMPTS TO COMMUNICATE THIS TO ME ON THEIR BEHALF AND SINCE ALL MONEY WAS PAID AS AGREED, WHEN I WENT TO COURT, THE CHARGE WAS DROPPED AND/OR NOLLE PROSSE.""
