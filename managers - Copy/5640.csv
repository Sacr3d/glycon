  ""Allegations"" : ""NASD 2110, 2330(A), 8210 AND IM-2310-2(B)(4)(A)(IV): ANDERSON MISAPPROPRIATED MONEY FROM CUSTOMERS' PENSION PLANS.  ANDERSON, A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR FOR A NUMBER OF PENSION PLANS, RECEIVED MONTHLY CHECKS FROM ONE CUSTOMER AND DEPOSITED THE FUNDS INTO HIS FIRM'S ACCOUNT, BUT FAILED TO FORWARD THE FUNDS TO THE COMPANY THAT THE CUSTOMER'S PENSION PLAN WAS INVESTED IN.  INSTEAD HE USED THE FUNDS, GATHERED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS AND TOTALING $222,700, FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT.  ANDERSON ALSO REMOVED FUNDS FROM ANOTHER CUSTOMER'S PENSION PLAN.  THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED ANDERSON WITH SEVERAL SIGNED BLANK WITHDRAWAL/TRANSFER FORMS IN ORDER TO EXECUTE PROMPT TRANSFERS OUT OF THE ACCOUNT FOR THE CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT.  ANDERSON USED ONE OF THESE BLANK FORMS TO WITHDRAW $250,000 FROM THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT TO COVER UP THE $222,700 HE HAD MISAPPROPRIATED FROM HIS CUSTOMER.  HE USED THE REMAINING FUNDS FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT.  FOLLOWING THIS WITHDRAWAL, ANDERSON CREATED AND PROVIDED TO HIS CUSTOMER FALSIFIED STATEMENTS CONTAINING INFORMATION THAT WOULD HAVE APPLIED IF THE $250,000 HAD NOT BEEN WITHDRAWN.  ANDERSON USED THE REMAINING BLANK FORMS TO FURTHER WITHDRAW FUNDS TOTALING $62,288 FROM HIS CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT AND ALSO USED THESE FUNDS FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT.  BECAUSE OF THE FALSIFIED STATEMENTS, ANDERSON WAS ABLE TO PREVENT THE CUSTOMER FROM DISCOVERING THE MISAPPROPRIATION IN EXCESS OF $312,000 FOR ABOUT 14 YEARS.  ANDERSON FAILED TO RESPOND TO A FINRA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS AND TO APPEAR FOR AN ON-THE-RECORD INTERVIEW."",
