  ""Broker Comment"" : ""FINANCIAL DURESS CREATED BY ECONOMIC DISTRESS OF NATIONAL ECONOMY IN 2008-2009 CAUSED A INCOME SHORTFALL.  I WORKED FOR SIX MONTHS WITHOUT AN INCOME IN ORDER TO MERGE MY BROKER-DEALER WITH ANOTHER B/D TO PRESERVE CLIENTS AND REPRESENTTIVES POSITION.  MY FINANCIAL RESOURCES WERE REDUCED IN ORDER TO MEET FINRA FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS TO MAINTAIN NET CAPITAL LEVEL OF FIRM.  THIS CAUSED ME TO STOP PAYING MY PERSONAL DEBTS IN ORDER TO KEEP THE FIRM VIABLE.   I INTEND TO PAY OFF MY DEBTS THROUGH A CHAPTER 13 BANKRUPTCY RE-ORGANIZATION. BANKRUPTCY WAS CHANGED FROM CHAPTER 13 TO CHAPTER 7.""
