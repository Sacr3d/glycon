  ""Allegations"" : ""WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, AYERS CONSENTED TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT HE ENGAGED IN A PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTION. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT AYERS FAILED TO PROVIDE PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE TO HIS MEMBER FIRM DESCRIBING IN DETAIL THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION, HIS PROPOSED ROLE THEREIN AND STATING WHETHER HE HAD RECEIVED OR MAY RECEIVE SELLING COMPENSATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION. THE TRANSACTION WAS OUTSIDE THE REGULAR COURSE OR SCOPE OF AYERS'S EMPLOYMENT WITH THE FIRM AND CONSTITUTED A PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTION. AYERS SIGNED AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT WITH A NON-MEMBER COMPANY THAT SOLD PROMISSORY NOTES TO INVESTORS IN CONNECTION WITH A PROGRAM OF OFFERING ENHANCED CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT (CD) PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY PROMISED A 9 PERCENT RETURN ON A 12-MONTH TERM FOR INVESTMENTS EXCEEDING $200,000 AND FALSELY REPRESENTED THAT ITS NOTES WERE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, AYERS WAS TO PROVIDE SALES LEADS TO THE COMPANY. A FIRM CUSTOMER OF AYERS'S INVESTED A TOTAL OF $500,000 IN NOTES OFFERED BY THE COMPANY AFTER AYERS INTRODUCED THE CUSTOMER TO THE COMPANY. THE SAME DAY, THE PENNSYLVANIA SECURITIES COMMISSION ISSUED A SUMMARY ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST AGAINST THE COMPANY AND ITS OWNERS WHO SOLICITED INVESTORS ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S NOTES WERE NOT REGISTERED AND WERE NOT SUBJECT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION. THE COMPANY PAID AYERS A $7,500 FINDER'S FEE AS COMPENSATION FOR REFERRING THE CUSTOMER. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT ON SEPARATE OCCASIONS, AYERS WILLFULLY FAILED TO TIMELY UPDATE HIS FORM U4 WITHIN 30 DAYS TO DISCLOSE THAT JUDGMENT LIENS FOR UNPAID TAXES WERE FILED AGAINST HIM."",
