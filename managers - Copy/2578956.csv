  ""Judgment/Lien Amount"" : ""$16,548.12"",
  ""Judgment/Lien Type"" : ""Tax"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The back taxes were caused by a layoff in November of 2016 and ensuing financial hardship. The taxes due were entirely generated by premature IRA distributions and the  10% penalty on those distributions. My unemployment and underemployment since the layoff have prevented me from being financially able to satisfy this debt. I have submitted paperwork to the state of Maryland for an \""offer in compromise\"".""
