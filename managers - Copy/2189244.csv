THE CLIENT DISCUSSED WITH ME INVESTMENT OPTIONS/ALTERNATIVES ON THE PHONE AND THEN DROVE BY HERSELF TO MEET ME AT A LOCAL US BANK BRANCH. THE CLIENT ASSURED ME SHE DID NOT NEED THE PROCEEDS FROM THE FIXED ANNUITY AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DOLLARS HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH. THE CLIENT STATED HER HOME WAS PAID FOR AND THE SAVINGS AND TEACHERS PENSION WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THEIR NEEDS. ALL DOCUMENTATION WAS SIGNED BY HER. MY BRANCH MANAGER HAD A THREE WAY CONFERENCE CALL WITH HIMSELF, THE CLIENT AND ME TO MAKE SURE EVERTHING WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HAD BEEN SIGNED AND DISCUSSED. THE BRANCH MANAGER WANTED THE FOLLOW-UP CALL DONE OUT OF RESPECT TO THE CLIENT'S AGE.THE CLIENT, AGAIN, ASSURED US THAT SHE DID NOT NEED THE DOLLARS AND GAVE US SPECIFICS ABOUT AMOUNTS AND LOCATIONS OF THEIR OTHER MONIES. THE CONFERENCE CALL IS DOCUMENTED.""
