  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC ADMININSTRATIVE RELEASES 34-54862 AND 40-27588, DECEMBER 1, 2006; THIS PROCEEDING CONCERNS KEVIN QUINN'S PROVISION OF EXTENSIVE TRAVEL, ENTERTAINMENT AND GIFTS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF AN INVESTMENT ADVISER (THE FUND ADVISER) TO A FAMILY OF MUTUAL FUNDS (THE FUNDS). THE EMPLOYEES INCLUDED SEVERAL EQUITIES SECURITIES TRADERS, WHOSE JOB WAS TO DIRECT SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS FOR THE FUNDS TO SECURITIES BROKERAGE FIRMS FOR EXECUTION, AND THE HEAD OF THE FUND ADVISER'S GLOBAL EQUITY TRADING DESK (HEAD OF EQUITY TRADING), WHO SUPERVISED THE SECURITIES TRADERS AND DECIDED WHICH SECURITIES BROKERAGE FIRMS WOULD BE APPROVED TO HANDLE EQUITY TRANSACTIONS FOR THE FUNDS. THE FIRM HIRED QUINN AND HIS TEAM OF REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES IN MAY 2002 TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE FIRM'S BROKERAGE BUSINESS WITH THE FUNDS. THE FIRM ANTICIPATED THAT QUINN'S CONNECTIONS WITH THE FUND ADVISER WOULD GENERATE AS MUCH AS $50 MILLION IN COMMISSION REVENUES PER YEAR FOR THE FIRM. QUINN RECEIVED $4 MILLION PER YEAR IN SALARY. QUINN'S TEAM ALSO RECEIVED AN ANNUAL TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT (T&E) BUDGET OF $1.5 MILLION, INCLUDING PRE-PAID USE OF PRIVATE PLANES FOR BUSINESS TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT. FROM MAY 2002 UNTIL OCTOBER 2004, QUINN SOUGHT TO OBTAIN BROKERAGE BUSINESS FROM THE FUNDS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EFFORT, QUINN PROVIDED TRAVEL, ENTERTAINMENT AND GIFTS TO A SMALL GROUP OF THE FUND ADVISER'S MOST SUCCESSFUL TRADERS. A SKILLED AMATEUR GOLFER WITH CONNECTIONS AT MANY EXCLUSIVE GOLF COURSES, QUINN TOOK THE TRADERS ON EXPENSIVE GOLF TRIPS, FLEW THEM ON PRIVATE PLANES, LODGED THEM AT FANCY HOTELS, AND GAVE THEM GOLF MERCHANDISE AND OTHER PRESENTS. HE ALSO MADE PRIVATE PLANES AVAILABLE FOR THE TRADERS TO TAKE ON PERSONAL TRIPS WITHOUT HIS ATTENDANCE. HE GAVE TICKETS TO THE FUND ADVISER'S TRADERS FOR MAJOR SPORTING EVENTS, BROADWAY SHOWS, AND CONCERTS, AGAIN WITHOUT HIS ATTENDANCE. HE EVEN HELPED PAY FOR ONE TRADER'S ELABORATE BACHELOR PARTY IN MIAMI. CONTINUED IN COMMENTS."",
