  ""Allegations"" : ""EXCESSIVE TRADING. THIS WAS A VERY ACTIVE ACCOUNT AND WE TRADED IT AS WE WERE DIRECTED BY THE CLIENT. WHEN THE CLIENT LOST MONEY IN THE ACCOUNT SHE WENT TO A LAWYER AND FILED A COMPLAINT. THE DATES ARE 03/98 TO 09/98.   WHEN SHE SUED, I HAD BEEN GONE FROM LA SALLE STREET SECUIRITIES, INC. FOR OVER TOW MONTHS (I RESIGNED TO PURSUE OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS). I DID NOT WANT TO SETTLE THIS CLAIM. I WANTED TO FIGHT IT OUT IN COURT BUT LA SALLE STREET SECURITIES WANTED TO SETTLE AND DECIDED TO SETTLE WITH OR WITHOUT ME. BECAUSE OF MY CONTRACT, I WOULD HAVE BEEN LEGALLY BOUND TO PAY MY SHARE OF THE SETTLEMENT ANYWAY, SO I DECIDED TO SIGN AND GET ON WITH MY LIFE."",
