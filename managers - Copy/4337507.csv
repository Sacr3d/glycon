  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MY SON WAS HOSPITALIZED IN 1998. DUE TO HIS ILLNESS MY INCOME WAS SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED. AFTER REALIZING I WAS UNABLE TO PAY HOSPITAL BILLS I WENT TO CONSUMER CREDIT COUNSELING SERVICE FOR DEBT MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER I WASN'T MAKING ENOUGH INCOME TO START PROGRAM. I GOT ANOTHER JOB AND STARTED MAKING MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO CENTRAL FINANCE THROUGH CONSUMER CREDIT COUNSELING. HOWEVER WITHOUT NOTIFICATION, CREDITOR DECIDED TO PERSUE LAWSUIT TO ENSURE PAYMENT. CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING WITH CREDITOR TO DETERMINE PAYOFF AMOUNT. CREDITOR HAS AGREED AFTER DEBT PAID OFF EITHER THROUGH MONTHLY PAYMENTS OR LUMP SUM PAYMENT, JUDGEMENT WILL BE DISMISSED. CURRENTLY PAYING $27.80 PER MONTH TOWARD DEBT.""
