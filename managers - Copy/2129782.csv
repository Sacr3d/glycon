  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE COMPLAINT WAS DETERMINED TO BE WITHOUT MERIT AND DENIED.  THE VARIABLE ANNUITY AT ISSUE WAS FULLY DISCUSSED TO THE CUSTOMER AND HER SON WHEN IT WAS SOLD IN 2009 AS A REPLACEMENT FOR AN OLDER POLICY THAT WAS OUT OF SURRENDER AND HAD FEWER INVESTMENT OPTIONS AND NO INCOME BENEFIT.  IN HER COMPLAINT, THE CUSTOMER APPEARED TO MISUNDERSTAND AND OVERSTATE THE AMOUNT OF COMMISSION THAT WAS GENERATED WHEN THE POLICY WAS PURCHASED.  THE REPRESENTATIVE DENIES ANY WRONGDOING WITH RESPECT TO THE CUSTOER AND BELIEVES THAT THE ANNUITY HAS SERVED THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS RECOMMENDED.""
