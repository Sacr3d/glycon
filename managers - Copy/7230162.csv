  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The whole thing stemmed from a fight my freshman year of college and was filed under 3 dockets because someone at the court house messed up but anyway. My roommate, who was involved in the fight, lied extensively about what happened but luckily I had 2 friends who witnessed and were able to clear everything up.  It never went to trial and every charge was dismissed except we reached a Continuance without a Finding on the assault and battery charge, which was dismissed upon completion of 18 months of probation. My record has since been sealed so it does not show up on a simple social security card background check.""
