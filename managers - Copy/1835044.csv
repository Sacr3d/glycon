  ""Allegations"" : ""NASD RULE 2110: BROWN, A FORMER REGISTERED EMPLOYEE OF A MEMBER FIRM, CAUSED AN ALTERED BANKRUPTCY DISCHARGE FORM TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE FIRM IN SUPPORT OF THE FALSE ASSERTION THAT A $116,395.25 DEBT BROWN OWED THE FIRM HAD BEEN DISCHARGED BY A PRIOR BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING.  AT THE TIME BROWN COMMENCED HIS EMPLOYMENT WITH THE FIRM, HE RECEIVED A TRANSITIONAL COMPENSATION LOAN FROM THE FIRM IN THE AMOUNT OF $116,395.25. THE LOAN WAS SECURED BY A PROMISSORY NOTE SIGNED BY BROWN ON MAY 3, 2006. WHEN BROWN VOLUNTARILY TERMINATED HIS EMPLOYMENT WITH THE FIRM, HE DID NOT REPAY THE LOAN WHEN HE LEFT THE FIRM. THE FIRM'S COUNSEL ADVISED BROWN IN A LETTER THAT REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN WAS REQUIRED; OTHERWISE THE FIRM WOULD TAKE APPROPRIATE LEGAL ACTION. IN RESPONSE TO THE FIRM'S LETTER, BROWN'S ATTORNEY SUBMITTED TO THE FIRM THE PURPORTED DISCHARGE OF DEBT FORM, WHICH WAS THE ALTERED DISCHARGE FORM. THE ALTERED DOCUMENT MADE IT FALSELY APPEAR THAT BROWN'S BANKRUPTCY DISCHARGE TOOK PLACE AFTER THE FIRM MADE THE TRANSITIONAL COMPENSATION LOAN TO BROWN IN MAY 2006 AND AFTER BROWN HAD LEFT THE FIRM WITHOUT REPAYING THE LOAN IN SEPTEMBER 2006, RATHER THAN BEFORE. THE ALTERED DISCHARGE FORM WAS AN ALTERED VERSION OF THE AUTHENTIC DISCHARGE FORM."",
