  ""Allegations"" : ""FINRA RULES 2010, 2150, NASD RULES 3010, 3070 - A MEMBER FIRM RECEIVED A COMPLAINT FROM A CUSTOMER EXPRESSING CONCERNS ABOUT HIS ACCOUNT, SUITABILITY OF PENNY STOCK TRADES, COMMISSIONS AND THE CONCENTRATION OF HIS ACCOUNT IN PENNY STOCKS. SIESENNOP, THE FIRM'S CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER (CCO)/FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONS PRINCIPAL (FINOP) SENT A LETTER TO THE CUSTOMER INCORPORATING A FORMAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WHICH WAS SIGNED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER AND ACCEPTED BY SIESENNOP ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT INCLUDED A PROVISION THAT CONDITIONED THE SETTLEMENT ON THE CUSTOMER NOT FILING A COMPLAINT WITH FINRA. SIESENNOP'S FAILURE TO REVIEW THE PRESIDENT'S SUPERVISION OF A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE, AS REQUIRED BY THE FIRM'S WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES, CONTRIBUTED TO THE FIRM'S FAILURE TO DETECT UNSUITABLE RECOMMENDATIONS IN A CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT. THE FIRM, THROUGH SIESENNOP, FAILED TO TIMELY DISCLOSE THE RECEIPT OF THE CUSTOMER'S WRITTEN COMPLAINT AND THE SETTLEMENT TO FINRA."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""WHILE I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE HEARING PANEL, I DISAGREE WITH THEIR FINDINGS.  THIS ISSUE IS NOT BEING PERSUED BY SIESENNOP FOR MONATARY REASONS.  THE ACTIONS BY SIESENNOP IN THE CLIENT CASE WAS COMPLETED IN AN EFFORT TO ASSIST THE CLIENT, AND WHILE NOT WORDED AS ACTFULLY AS A LAWYER WOULD RESULT WAS BENEFICIAL TO THE CLIENT.  THE PANEL SUGGESTS THAT SIESENNOP INTENTIONALLY INSERTED INACCURATE INFORMATION OF A FORM, WITH AN INTENT TO MISLEAD.  THERE SO NO INTENT TO MISLEAD, ONLY TO COMPLETE A DOCUMENT THAT HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED.  THE PANEL ALSO SUGGESTS THE THE BOOKS AND RECORDS WERE THEREFORE PURPOSEFULLY INACCUATE.  I CONTEND THAT IF UNAWARE OF INACCURATE INFORMATION, HOW CAN THE ACT BE PURPOSEFUL.""
