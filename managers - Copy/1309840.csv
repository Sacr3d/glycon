ENNIS. ENNIS WAS INVOLVED IN A MARKET TIMING AGREEMENT THAT PERMITTED A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE TO MAKE, ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF HIS CUSTOMERS, FREQUENT TRADES IN EXCESS OF THE EXCHANGE LIMITS SET FORTH IN THE A MUTUAL FUND'S PROSPECTUS.  IN JANUARY 2000, ENNIS AGREED TO PERMIT A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE TO MARKET TIME ONE OR MORE FUNDS ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF HIS CUSTOMERS EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THAT HIS FIRM HAD AN ANTI-MARKET TIMING POLICY, CONSISTENT WITH WHICH EACH MUTUAL FUND PROSPECTUS LIMITED EXCHANGES TO THREE PER CALENDAR QUARTER AND FIVE PER CALENDAR YEAR, AND EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THAT MARKET TIMING COULD DISRUPT FUND MANAGEMENT AND HARM FUND PERFORMANCE. THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE SUBSEQUENTLY MADE APPROXIMATELY 386 EXCHANGES INTO AND OUT OF THE FUND FROM APPROXIMATELY JANUARY 2001 THROUGH MARCH 2003. THIS TIMING ACTIVITY HARMED THE FUND. FROM JANUARY 2001 THROUGH MARCH 2003, ENNIS SIGNED SEVERAL FUND REGISTRATION STATEMENTS, EACH OF WHICH INCORPORATED THE FUND'S PROSPECTUS AND THE EXCHANGE LIMITS CONTAINED THEREIN. AT NO POINT DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE WAS MAKING THESE EXCHANGES DID ENNIS DISCLOSE THE MARKET TIMING ARRANGEMENT TO THE FUND'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES. ENNIS WILLFULLY AIDED AND ABETTED AND CAUSED A COMPANY'S VIOLATIONS OF SECTIONS 206(1) AND 206(2) OF THE ADVISERS ACT, WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTION 34(B) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND WILLFULLY AIDED AND ABETTED AND CAUSED A FIRM'S VIOLATION OF SECTION 17(D) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND RULE 17D-1 THEREUNDER."",
