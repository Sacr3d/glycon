  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Plaintiffs allege that RR solicited the purchase of un-registered securities from an un-registered financial advisor. Please note, the plaintiffs are not customers of Park Avenue Securities (PAS), but are customers of Guardian Life Insurance Company, PAS' parent company.  Customer alleged that RR solicited the purchase of unregistered securities from an unregistered financial advisor. RR denied these allegations, and specifically denied making recommendations to customer with respect to his/her alleged investments or the alleged unregistered financial advisor. RR specifically  denied recommending the alleged unregistered financial advisor and denied having received any compensation or payment related to customer's alleged investments. RR and Park Avenue Securities settled customer's complaint out of court, with no admission of wrongdoing. The consideration provided in connection with the Settlement Agreement was made solely in compromise of disputed claims and defenses, and nothing contained therein shall be construed as an admission of liability by RR. RR is reporting customer's allegations and the resolution thereof solely to comply with applicable requirements that RRs report such complaints, regardless of whether any wrongdoing is deemed to have occurred. RRs are required to report any such allegations or complaints made by an individual about a registered representative.""
