  ""Broker Comment"" : ""CUSTOMER CAME TO OUR OFFICE AS A REFERRAL FROM ONE OUR LONG TIME CLIENTS [THIRD PARTY].  SHE WAS EXCITED ABOUT WHAT THE MARKET HAD DONE AND WAS LOOKING FOR MORE GROWTH IN HER PORTFOLIO.  WE SUGGESTED VARIABLE ANNUITIES FOR THE TAX DEFERRAL, DEATH BENEFITS, AND EASE OF CHANGING ALLOCATIONS WITHOUT TAX CONSEQUENCE.  SHE INVESTED AT THE TOP OF THE MARKET AND AS THE MARKET STARTED TO DROP, SHE HAD BUYER'S REMORSE.  I PERSONALLY SET UP MONTHLY TELEPHONE REVIEWS WITH HER TO GO OVER HER ACCOUNTS AND DISCUSS THE ASSET ALLOCATION AS I KNEW HOW UPSET SHE WAS.  CUSTOMER BEGAN ASKING ME TO TAKE HER OUT, PUT HER IN ETC, AND I EMPHASIZED THAT THIS IS TIMING AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN MARKET TIMING. WE SUGGESTED AFTER THE INITIAL FALL THAT SHE CONSIDER MOVING A PORTION OF HER ACCOUNTS INTO BONDS AND KEEP A PORTION IN THE EQUITIES MARKET.  AFTER APPROX 5 MONTHS, WE NOTICED THAT SHE CALLED IN AND SURRENDERED HER ANNUITIES WITHOUT A CALL TO US FOR INFORMATION ON CHARGES, PENALTIES ETC.  SUBSEQUENTLY WE NEVER HEARD FROM HER AGAIN AND HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HER SINCE THE COMPLAINT.""
