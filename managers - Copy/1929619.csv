BROKER WILL BE PAYING $4,000.00  SHEARON WILL PAY $8,000.00 WHEN I OPENED THIS ACCOUNT I MET WITH [CUSTOMER'S] AND [OTHER CUSTOMER NAMED] TO REVIEW OPTIONS FOR HIGH YIELDING MONTHLY INCOME. TWO CHOICES WE ULTIMATELY FOCUSED ON WERE HIGH YIELD TRUSTS AND GNMAS. I EXPLAINED THE RISKS OF EACH TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE. UNFORTUNATELY, WAS BRAND NEW TO THE BUSINESS AND DIDN'T QUITE SEE HOW VERY LARGE THE RISK OF PRINCIPLE WAS IN THE HIGH YIELD TRUST. THE CLIENT WANTED THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE INCOME AND CHOSE THE HIGH YIELD TRUST. MY FIRM HAD IT'S NAME ON IT AND RECOMMENDED IT IN A TRAINING PROGRAM. AT THE TIME, THE RISKS IN THESE TRUSTS WERE NOT CLEAR.""
