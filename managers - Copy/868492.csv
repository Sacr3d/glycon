  ""Broker Comment"" : ""COMPLAINT WAS A RESULT OF MY LEAVING MY MANAGEMENT POSITION AT PRUDENTIAL IN 1995.  I TOOK OVER AN AGENCY, OTHERWISE CALLED A DEBIT, WHICH HAD EXISTING CLIENTS.  ONE HAPPENED TO BE THIS CLIENT.  PRUDENTIAL AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNED YOU AS AGENT OF RECORD ON ANNUAL STATEMENTS FOR LIFE INSURANCE WHEN TO TAKE OVER AN AGENCY.  THE CONTRACT WAS SOLD IN 1994 THROUGH ANOTHER AGENT THAT I NEVER MET.  I NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH CLIENT, BUT AS I WAS ASSIGNED THE AGENCY, HE WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION I WAS HIS ORIGINAL AGENT.  THE COMPLAINT WAS IN AUGUST OF 2002, 5 YEARS AFTER I LEFT PRUDENTIAL.  NEVER HAVING SOLD THE CLIENT OR EVEN MEETING HIM, THE ACCUSATIONS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ME WHATSOEVER.  PRUDENTIAL IN THE MID 90'S, WAS GOING THROUGH A REMEDIATION PROCESS WHERE THEY WERE REQUIRED TO BE PROACTIVE IN SEEKING OUT DISSATISFIED CLIENTS.  ONCE THEY ENTERED INTO THE REMEDIATION PROGRAM, THE CLIENTS WERE NO LONGER ALLOWED TO BE CONTACTED BY THE AGENT.  WITH THAT SAID, PRUDENTIAL JUST RETURNED THE CLIENT FUNDS WITH LITTLE OR NO INPUT FROM AGENT TO AVOID REGULATORY ISSUES.""
