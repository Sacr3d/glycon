  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN 2007, SHORTLY AFTER I STARTED WORKING FOR REGIONS BANK, I DID A MAIL AWAY HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT THAT INVOLVED A SON IN OCALA, FL AND HIS FATHER IN NEW YORK. I USED A SEPARATE NOTARY PAGE FOR THE NOTARY IN NEW YORK TO SIGN, STATING THAT THEY WERE IN WITNESS OF THE FATHER'S SIGNATURE. ONCE I RECEIVED THE LOAN PACKAGE BACK IN OCALA, I CONTACTED THE SON TO HAVE HIM COME INTO THE BANK AND NOTARIZED HIS PORTION WHILE I WAS WITNESSING HIM SIGN. SINCE THERE WAS ONLY ONE SPOT ON THE REGION'S BANK DOCUMENT, IT APPEARED THAT I HAD NOTARIZED BOTH CUSTOMERS' SIGNATURES, WHICH IS WHY I USED THE SEPARATE NOTARY DOCUMENT FOR THE NEW YORK NOTARY, TO ALLEVIATE ANY CONFUSION. WHEN THE PACKAGE WAS COMPLETE I SENT IT UP TO CORPORATE, ALONG WITH THE SEPARATE NOTARY PAGE, WHERE IT WAS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY VARIOUS LEVELS OF LOAN OFFICERS AND UNDERWRITERS. IN ADDITION, ALL OF THE ABOVE WAS REVIEWED, APPROVED, AND DONE UNDER THE DIRECTION OF MY MANAGER AT THE TIME.  5 YEARS LATER, REGIONS BANK BROUGHT THIS EVENT TO MY ATTENTION AND CLAIMED THAT THERE WAS NOT A SEPARATE NOTARY PAGE AND THAT, EVEN IF THERE WAS, IT COULD NOT BE USED SINCE IT WAS NOT AN OFFICIAL REGIONS DOCUMENT. THEREFORE, THEY LET ME GO, BUT SAID IT WOULD BE DOCUMENTED AS A \""LAYOFF\"". I FOUND OUT A FEW WEEKS LATER THAT THE POSITION I HELD WAS ELIMINATED AT SEVERAL REGIONS BANK BRANCHES. SO IT APPEARED THAT THEY LET ME GO AS A WAY TO AVOID PAYING ME A SEVERANCE PACKAGE.""
