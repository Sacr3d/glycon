  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THERE WERE NO FORMAL CHARGES FILED - THIS IS NOT REPORTABLE   I WAS A PASSENGER IN A TRUCK OWNED BY AN ASSOCIATE. HE WAS INTOXICATED AND WAS STOPPED BY THE POLICE IN TUCSON, ARIZ. HE HAD A BIKE HE OWNED IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. HE BEGAN TO VERBALLY ABUSE THE OFFICERS, SO THEY ARRESTED US BOTH FOR STEALING THE BIKE. A FEW HOURS LATER THEY FOUND OUT THAT HE DID OWN THE BIKE, SO THEY DROPPED CHARGES AGAINST ME AND RELEASED ME. I BELIEVE THAT THEY CHARGED HIM WITH A D.U.I. I HAVE SINCE HIRED A LAWYER AND I THOUGHT THIS CHARGE WOULD FOREVER BE EXPUNGED FROM ANY RECORDS!   *** SEE INCIDENT NO.2 FOR RELATED DOJ REPORT. ***""
