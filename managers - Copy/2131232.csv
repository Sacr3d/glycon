  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Cornerstone healthcare REIT/Sentio Healthcare REIT-[REDACTED] invested approximately $88K and had a total return to her upon liquidation of approximately $160K+.  Life Partners (approved outside business activity)-[REDACTED] invested a total of $60K in four fractional shares of life settlement policies for $15k each. Two policies matured in mid 2017 paying out $30k basis plus approximately $30K additional. The other $30k is in an IRA with a current value in excess of $8K. The trustee for the trust anticipates a payout of 90 to 95% of the total value invested over the next 10 +/- years.These projections are those of the trusee. United Development Fund-[REDACTED] invested approximately $30k partially in a traditional IRA and partially in a Roth IRA in 2011. UDF remained non-traded until mid-2014 when it listed on the NASDAQ. UDF performed extremely well until the end of 2015 when UDF was attacked (short and distort scheme) by a Hedge Fund headed by Kyle Bass. Kyle Bass is currently under investigation by the SEC as was disclosed at the last appeals court hearing. Current approximate value is in excess of $8k plus distributions of approximately $2 to $3k. UDF is expecting to release their financials within the next few months and expecting an increase in value of its shares and well as listing back on the NASDAQ.""

Immediately upon opening her account, Parker recommended that the customer invest her funds into illiquid, alternative investments. The source of these funds was the customer's retirement account.
