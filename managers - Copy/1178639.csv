  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The client filled out the complaint form on finra.org which we were notified of via information request on 08/14/19. There was no activity with the clients since before the original complaint. The activity in which the form filled out on finra.org and the complaint received in 2017 was the same activity.  The reps comment is: I vehemently deny all allegations against me.  One of the products in question was a Regulation D Private Placement purchased in 2010 for which the client received all the disclosure documents including those highlighting the risks.  The clients filled out and properly executed subscription documents that were accepted by Manager of fund. All communications regarding fund were sent or made by the fund manager and anytime clients asked me questions regarding the fund I referred them to the fund manager. The client still owns this product and is still receiving distributions. The client received statements and 1099's  directly from all custodians involved not from the rep or firm. The client called rep hundreds of times over the years asking to be traded more aggressively and invited rep to his house in the summer of 2015 to talk about a more aggressive strategy.""
