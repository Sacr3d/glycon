  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE LEHMAN BROTHERS BOND WAS ORIGINALLY PURCHASED IN NOVEMBER 2004.  FA STATED CLIENTS INFORMED HIM THEY HAD FUNDS THEY WANTED TO BRING TO EDWARD JONES AND PURCHASE AN INCOME PRODUCING INVESTMENT THAT WOULD PAY HIGHER THAN THEIR CREDIT UNION.  AFTER DISCUSSING OPTIONS, FA INDICATED IT WAS DETERMINED THE LEHMAN BROTHERS BOND WOULD MEET THEIR NEEDS AND THEY AUTHORIZED THE PURCHASE OF THE BOND WHICH WAS RATED A/A1 AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE.  ACCORDING TO FA, HE DISCUSSED THE FEATURES OF THE BOND INCLUDING ASSOCIATED RISKS.  FA STATED, AND OUR RECORDS INDICATE, HE DID NOT LIQUIDATE INVESTMENTS TO PURCHASE THE BOND.  THE BOND WAS PURCHASED USING NEW MONEY DEPOSITED IN THEIR ACCOUNT (BANK CHECK#).  CLIENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH A TRADE CONFIRMATION AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND CUSTOMER STATEMENTS REFLECTING THE ACTIVITY AND THIS POSITION.  IT DOES NOT APPEAR CONCERNS WERE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION PRIOR TO THEIR LETTER AND THE CONCERNS WITH LEHMAN BROTHERS. BASED ON OUR REVIEW, WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY DENY ANY REQUEST FOR COMPENSATION RELATED TO THIS MATTER.  AS ADDITIONAL NEWS BECOMES AVAILABLE EDWARD JONES FINANCIAL ADVISOR WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION.  CLAIM DENIED.""
