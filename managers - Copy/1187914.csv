  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE MATTER WAS SETTLED FOR $23,500.  I WAS NOT CONSULTED AND DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THE INVESTMENT WAS UNSUITABLE OR THAT THERE WAS ANY FRAUD.  AMST HAD THE FIRM'S HIGHEST POSSIBLE SHORT AND LONG TERM RANKING AT THE TIME OF THE PURCHASE.  THE CUSTOMER WAS A PHOTOGRAPHER, THE SAME BUSINESS AS THE COMPANY, AND HAD PROFITED ON A PREVIOUS INVESTMENT IN AMST SHARES.  THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED REDUCED EARNINGS AND THE STOCK PRICE DROPPED SUBSTANTIALLY.  ONLY THEN DID THE CUSTOMER COMPLAIN.  I BELIEVE HIS UNSPECIFIED ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD ARE BASED ON A CLASS ACTION SUIT RELATING TO AMST'S DISCLOSURE ABOUT EARNINGS.""
