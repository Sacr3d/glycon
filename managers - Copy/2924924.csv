This measure was taken in no way out of personal irresponsibility but on the advice of legal counsel and securities regulators (FINRA). The primary purpose, to maintain licenses through this negotiation and settlement process. The dispute was with a prior employer (MS) who was, at the time, unwilling to arrange or negotiate reasonable terms of settlement. The settlement agreement was paid in full.""
