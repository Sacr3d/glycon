  ""Allegations"" : ""WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, GREEN CONSENTED TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT HE COMMUNICATED WITH SECURITIES INVESTORS, AT LEAST ONE OR WHOM WAS A MEMBER FIRM'S CUSTOMER, REGARDING A SECURITIES-RELATED BUSINESS USING A NON-FIRM EMAIL ADDRESS THAT WAS NOT APPROVED, REGISTERED OR MONITORED BY THE FIRM, IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE FIRM'S POLICIES. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT GREEN'S USE OF HIS UNAPPROVED AND UNREGISTERED EMAIL ADDRESS TO COMMUNICATE WITH SECURITIES CUSTOMERS PREVENTED THE FIRM FROM EFFECTIVELY SUPERVISING HIS COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC. GREEN'S ACTIONS ALSO PREVENTED THE FIRM FROM COMPLYING WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS TO PRESERVE EMAILS IN CONFORMANCE WITH RECORD KEEPING RULES. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT GREEN FAILED TO TIMELY RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION SENT TO HIM BY FINRA."",
