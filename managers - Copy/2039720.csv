  ""Allegations"" : ""The Securities and Exchange Commission (\""Commission\"") alleges that this matter involves an offering fraud orchestrated by the founder and owner of Defendant DJB Holdings, LLC (\""DJBennett\""), a Washington D.C.-based retail sports apparel business, and aided and abetted by Defendant Bradley C. Mascho (\""Mascho\""), Chief Financial Officer of DJBennett, and DJBennett's owner's long-time confidante (collectively, \""Defendants\"").   From December 2014 through at least July 2017, Defendants raised more than $20 million from at least 46 investors through the unregistered offering of DJBennett convertible and promissory notes (collectively, the \""Notes\"") by fraudulently misrepresenting and omitting material facts to investors regarding DJBennett's financial condition and operating performance, the risks associated with the investment, and the intended use of investor proceeds.   DJBennett's owner for years operated a financial advisory business. By the outset of the fraud, however, DJBennett's owner had lost a significant portion of her financial advisory clientele, and DJBennett had incurred millions of dollars in losses. As her financial condition rapidly deteriorated, DJBennett's owner began accumulating a variety of personal financial obligations, but nonetheless continued to spend considerable sums to fund her extravagant lifestyle.   In an effort to sustain DJBennett and tap a new income stream, DJBennett's owner, assisted by Mascho, turned to the fraudulent sale of the Notes. Defendants frequently targeted elderly and financially unsophisticated investors by materially misrepresenting the company's profitability and by claiming the company had the resources to pay an annual rate of return of 15%. Defendants also lied about DJBennett's extensive liabilities and the risks associated with the investment. Although Defendants represented that investor funds would be used for corporate purposes, much of the proceeds were diverted for a variety of improper purposes, including payments to earlier investors in the nature of a Ponzi scheme, to service debt, and to finance a variety of luxuries on behalf of DJBennett's owner, such as jewelry, high-end clothing, mystics, and a $500,000 annual lease for a luxury suite at AT&T Stadium in Dallas.   DJBennett's owner and Mascho also employed a variety of other fraudulent devices to further the scheme and avoid detection. For example, DJBennett's owner and Mascho took steps to circumvent Broker-Dealer 1's surveillance system to prevent the firm from learning of their unauthorized Note sales to Broker-Dealer 1 customers. They also fraudulently obtained several loans through the submission of fabricated brokerage statements that inflated DJBennett's owner's assets; these loans afforded Defendants the funds necessary to meet investor demands for interest and redemption payments.   Additionally, upon learning that a regulator was investigating their sale of long-term convertible notes, and as part of a misguided effort to place their activities outside the jurisdiction of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, DJBennett's owner and Mascho directed investors to execute new short-term promissory notes. Defendants then, in effect, backdated the new short-term promissory notes to the date of the investors' original convertible note investment. This fraudulent \""backdating\"" scheme allowed DJBennett's owner and Mascho to corroborate the lies they told to the investigating regulator and Broker-Dealer 1 about their involvement in the sale of the convertible notes.   Mascho violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\""Securities Act\""). Mascho aided and abetted in the violations of 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\""Exchange Act\"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder."",

Not only did the securities recommendations in questions find their genesis in Respondent Dawn Bennett, not Mr. Mascho, but the recommendations were entirely suitable to the Claimants, given their repeatedly stated investment objective and risk tolerance, their constant awareness of account value (accessing the account online 375 times) and their years of rejecting recommendations to diversify and reduce margin risk. Claimants retained the securities positions they claimed were unsuitable for over a half year after they left Western for a discount brokerage firm. There was no claim of unauthorized trading since all trades were approved beforehand by the Claimants.""
