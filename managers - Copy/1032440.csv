  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN MY INITIAL MEETING WITH THE CLIENT, WE DISCUSSED INVESTING IN A FEE-BASED ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.  THE CLIENT APPROVED THE INVESTMENT AND COMPLETED ALL NECESSARY DOCUMENTS FOR TRANSFER AND PURCHASE SINCE THE INVESTMENT WAS TO BE FUNDED BY ASSETS AT FIDELITY.  THE CLIENT WAS UNHAPPY TO LEARN THAT ONLY A PORTION OF THE FIDELITY ASSETS TRANSFERRED.  HE REQUESTED TO MEET WITH ME AND MY PARTNER BUT HE NEVER RETURNED OUR CALLS TO CONFIRM A DATE.  THEREAFTER, COMPLIANCE ADVISED ME THAT THEY WOULD ADDRESS THE CLIENT'S CONCERNS AND I WAS INSTRUCTED NOT TO CONTACT THE CLIENT.  THE CLIENT SETTLED FOR $4,800 AND I WAS TERMINATED FOR ALLEGEDLY EXERCISING DISCRETION IN A CLIENT ACCOUNT WITHOUT WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION. I DENY THE ALLEGATIONS AND THE CLIENT EXPRESSED HIS REMORSE FOR MY TERMINATION.""
