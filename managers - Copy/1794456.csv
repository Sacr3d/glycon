  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS EMPLOYED BY THE BANK OF NEW MEXICO AS A TRUST OFFICER. I WAS  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE FEDERAL FIDUCIARY INCOME TAX RETURNS (FORM 941) FOR THE YEARS 1974 & 1975. I HAD BECOME OVERBURDENED BY OTHER DUTIES FOR THE YEAR 1976 AND RECEIVED PERMISSION TO HAVE THE RETURNS PREPARED BY AN OUTSIDE SOURCE FOR THAT TAX YEAR. I DECIDED THAT I COULD FORM A PARTNERSHIP WITH SOME ACCOUNTANTS AND PREPARE THE RETURNS ON MY OWN TIME AWAY FROM THE BANK. AT MY OWN EXPENSE AND TIME I PREPARED THE RETURNS. HOWEVER, THE ACCOUNTANTS COULD NOT PARTICIPATE DUE TO POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THE BANK HAD ALREADY BEEN BILLED BY THE PARTNERSHIP AND PAID THE FEE TO AN ACCOUNT THAT DID NOT EXIST DUE TO TERMINATION OF PARTNERSHIP.""
