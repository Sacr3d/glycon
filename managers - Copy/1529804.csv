  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Admin Release 34-77546, April 6, 2016: The SEC deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against Thomas E. Skypeck. In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer of Settlement that the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent admits the Commission's jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the findings contained herein, and consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions. On the basis of this Order and Respondent's Offer, the Commission finds that on October 9, 2015, Skypeck pleaded guilty to one count of theft by unauthorized taking or transfer, one count of intentional or knowing violation of the Maine Uniform Securities Act, one count of forgery, and one count of misuse of entrusted property in Docket No. CR-15-276. Skypeck's sentencing has been deferred to allow him time to comply with terms of his plea agreement, including paying $5,070 in restitution. On June 23, 2015, Skypeck entered into a consent agreement with the Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation's Bureau of Insurance whereby he agreed to the revocation of his Maine resident insurance producer's license and to pay a fine of $1,000 and restitution of $1,000, with a further agreement that he may owe additional restitution once the full amount has been determined."",
