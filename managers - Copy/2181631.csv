  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Pollard consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he created backdated documents which he then submitted to FINRA. The findings stated that in connection with a routine examination of the firm, FINRA requested that the firm provide lists of the OBAs of the firm's registered persons, and, if available, documents showing the firm's approval of those OBAs. Pollard created documents containing lists of OBAs for two persons registered through the firm and received a list of OBAs from a third person registered through the firm. The third person's list had been backdated, and Pollard then backdated the two OBA lists he drafted. Pollard then submitted these backdated documents to FINRA. In response to a request from FINRA for evidence of supervisory review and approval of the OBA lists, Pollard, who was a principal of the firm at the time, initialed two of the three lists. Pollard asked another registered principal of the firm to sign Pollard's OBA list, and that other registered person also backdated his signature. Pollard then submitted these backdated documents to FINRA. Although the firm had approved the representatives' OBAs, the backdated documents that Pollard produced to FINRA purported to show that the firm had approved them in writing and had maintained the three OBA lists prior to FINRA's request, when, in fact, that was not the case."",
