  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Champney consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that his member firm failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures (WSPs), reasonably designed to identify and prevent unsuitable excessive trading and churning in customer accounts. The findings stated that Champney, the firm's principal, reviewed the firm's monthly activity report and determined, in his discretion, whether the appearance of a customer account on the report warranted action. The firm's WSPs did not provide any guidance about how to determine whether further action was warranted. The firm's procedures did not require that any action be taken when a customer's account appeared on the activity report. However, a registered representative, for whom Champney was his direct business-line supervisor, effected more than 3,500 transactions in a retired 93-year-old customer's accounts, which resulted in approximately $723,000 in trading losses and generated approximately $735,000 in commissions and markups for the representative and the firm. The findings also stated that the firm, through Champney, failed to reasonably supervise the registered representative who engaged in churning and unsuitable excessive trading in the brokerage accounts of the senior customer. Champney observed numerous red flags indicating that the representative was engaging in misconduct in the customer's accounts and did not reasonably respond to these red flags. Approximately six months after the elderly customer opened his accounts with the firm, Champney sent the customer a satisfaction letter. The letter did not include any information about the level of activity in the customer's accounts or the losses or commissions associated with that activity. Champney did not discuss the activity, commissions, or losses with the customer or take steps, as the representative's supervisor, to ensure that the representative did so. As the representative's supervisor, Champney subsequently became aware of continued trading, losses, and commissions in the customer's accounts. Champney observed that the customer's accounts appeared on the firm's activity report 23 out of 30 months and he experienced heavy losses and paid significant commissions. During these four years, Champney met with the customer once, with his son, after the customer misplaced his debit card. During this meeting, neither the representative nor Champney raised with the customer the extensive losses and commissions associated with the trading in his accounts. One day later, Champney sent a second satisfaction letter to the customer. Champney did not include any information about the level of activity in the accounts or the losses or commissions associated with that activity in this letter or in any other communication with the customer. Champney knew that the customer called the representative nearly every day, often multiple times a day, and he knew that the customer relied on him for information about his accounts. Champney was also aware of an email that the customer's son sent to the representative, concerning his father's accounts. Neither the representative nor Champney followed up with the customer in response to his son's email."",

  ""Sanctions"" : ""Respondent understands that this settlement includes a finding that he failed to supervise an individual who violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that under Article III, Section 4 of FINRA's By-Laws, this makes him subject to a statutory disqualification with respect to association with a member."",
  ""Regulator Statement"" : ""Consequently, the firm and its representative, the one who Champney failed to reasonably supervise from engaging in the churning and unsuitable excessive trading in the retired 93-year-old customer's accounts, made a settlement payment totaling $470,000 to the guardian for the retired customer's accounts. In addition, FINRA barred the representative, whom Champney failed to reasonably supervise, from associating with any FINRA member firm in any capacity in FINRA AWC Case No. 2015045984001. Fines paid in full on August 13, 2018."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, the respondent consented to the entry of findings and the sanctions imposed in order to resolve this matter.    The firm has continuously made operational and compliance systems improvements to detect and prevent future incidents..""
