  ""Allegations"" : ""Client, over age 70, transferred in an aggressive portfolio in June 2020.  Advisor recommended a less risky allocation for her portfolio.  Client agreed and changes were implemented in July 2020.  Client became upset that selling of original securities had realized her market losses thereby reducing her recovery when the market rebounded."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Advisor strongly denies the merit of this complaint and client withdrew it.  Client meeting and discussion revealed that she was taking far too much risk for her age and profile.  The accounts she transferred in had unrealized losses of between 20-30%.  Client agreed that replacing this unsuitable portfolio was the correct move.  Only after seeing a sharp and impossible-to-predict recovery does did client \""wish\"" she had retained the more aggressive portfolio.  Advisor-managed accounts gained between 6-8% during Advisor's management.  Firm answered the complaint.  Client, in written response, withdrew her complaint and apologized.""
