  ""Broker Comment"" : ""RR indicates \""I met with the client multiple times prior to completing the variable annuity purchase. I reviewed and explained all costs, fees, risks and benefits of the product; all required disclosures were presented and signed by the client. I believe the resulting transaction was suitable for the client based on the information that she provided to me and our needs assessment.  There were no suitability issues raised at the time of the transaction by the client or LPL.  I departed LPL in February 2016 - this complaint is dated March 2016; I was not aware that there was an issue raised by the client until I was notified via FINRA in September 2018\""""
