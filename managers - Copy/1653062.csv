  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS CUSTOMER COMPLAINT IS NO LONGER REPORTABLE. ON 6/14/01 ANOTHER MARGIN SELLOUT NOTICE WAS RECEIVED AND I CONFIRMED THE AMOUNT WITH THE MARGIN DEPARTMENT PRIOR TO CONTACTING THE CLIENT. I ATTEMPTED TO REACH THE CLIENT ON ALL PHONE NUMBERS AND LEFT A MESSAGE ON HIS CELL PHONE-THE AMOUNT DUE WAS $11,700. THE MESSAGE WAS LEFT AT 9:01 A.M. CENTRAL TIME. I DEBITED HIS CHECKING ACCOUNT PER PRIOR INSTRUCTIONS. 6/15/01 ANOTHER HOUSE CALL DUE FOR $1000-I DISCUSSED YESTERDAYS FED CALL, TRANSFER AND TODAY'S HOUSE CALL. THE STOCK HAD RECOVERED A BIT DURING THE DAY AFTER A POSITIVE ANALYST REPORT AND IT APPEARED THAT THE HOUSE CALL MIGHT BE LIFTED IF THE STOCK CONTINUED TO RISE. WE DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL MONDAY TO SEE WHAT THE STOCK WOULD DO. I DID NOT HEAR FROM THE CLIENT ON MONDAY AND THE STOCK LOST VALUE. 6/18/01 I LEFT A MESSAGE AT 3:00 P.M. THAT CLIENT WOULD LIKELY BE IN A MARGIN CALL TOMORROW MORNING-STOCK HAD FALLEN FROM APPROXIMATELY $7 PER SHARE TO $6 PER SHARE. 6/19/01 SPOKE TO CLIENT AT 9:36 A.M. AND TOLD HIM THAT A SELLOUT WAS LIKELY FOR THE NEXT DAY DUE TO THE STOCKS CONTINUED DECLINE-HE INSTRUCTED ME TO SELL OUT HIS ENTIRE POSITION. STOCK SOLD FOR APPROXIMATELY $5 PER SHARE. THE CLIENT ENDED UP WITH A DEBIT BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $8500. THE CLIENT'S ASSERTION THAT HE WAS NOT PROPERLY NOTIFIED OF MARGIN REQUIREMENTS ON A TIMELY BASIS IS WITHOUT MERIT. I NEVER RECOMMENDED THE STOCK TO THE CLIENT AND OFFERED SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE HIS RISK THAT THE CLIENT CHOSE TO NOT IMPLEMENT.""
