  ""Broker Comment"" : ""AROUND MAY OF 2011, MY HOUSEHOLD CHANGED BANKS. IN CLOSING THE FIRST ACCOUNT, AN OUTSTANDING CHECK TO LCISD IN THE AMOUNT OF $44.44 WAS STILL OUTSTANDING AND INADVERTENTLY FORGOTTEN. WHEN THAT CHECK WAS EVENTUALLY PRESENTED IT DID NOT CLEAR. WITHOUT CONTACTING ME, LCISD PRESSED CHARGES. THIS WENT UNNOTICED BY ME UNTIL I RECEIVED NOTICE TO APPEAR IN COURT ON THE IBC CHARGE IN OCTOBER OF 2011. IT WAS DECIDED THAT PAYING THE COURT ASSESSED FINE, WHICH INCLUDED RESTITUTION TO LCISD AND A PLEA OF NOLO CONTENDERE, WAS THE MOST EXPEDIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF RESOLVING THIS ERROR AND ON 10/19/2011 I DID JUST THAT.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""When [Partner] and I established Navigant Investment Advisors, LLC in 2008, we engaged the services of [Third Party] acting for RIA In A Box as a registration compliance consultant.  We provided him with all required registration information.  We did not begin to conduct the business of offering investment advisory services until we were advised by RIA In A Box that our registrations were complete and active.   When this issue came up, we went back to [Third Party], the founder of RIA In A Box with whom we had dealt directly, and were assured that all registration requirements were filed correctly.  He took up the issue on our behalf and advised us that he had hit a bureaucratic brick wall whereby he had shown documented evidence of compliance on our behalf but they would not find that satisfactory.  He advised that he would reimburse me and Navigant for the fines and we could continue operations or we could hire legal representation and fight this in court for an indeterminate period of time.  We opted for the more expeditious approach, paid the fines, and accepted his reimbursement.""
