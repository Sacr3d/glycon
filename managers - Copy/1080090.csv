  ""Allegations"" : ""CLIENT MCARTHUR ESTABLISHED AN IRA WITH PIONEER THROUGH FINANCIAL CONSULTANT MILLER.  MCARTHUR, WITH ASSISTANCE OF MILLER, FILLED OUT CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY FORM FOR PIONEER TO CHANGE BETTY HUNT TO THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IN OCTOBER 2000.  CLIENT MCARTHUR PASSED AWAY AND BETTY HUNT, BELIEVING SHE WAS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF HIS IRA ACCOUNT, REQUESTED PAYMENT ($63,978.80) FROM PIONEER IN FEBRUARY 2005.  THE CLAIM WAS DENIED BY PIONEER BECAUSE THE CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY PAPERWORK NAMING HUNT AS PRIMARY BENEFICIARY WAS NOT VALID DUE TO WITNESS NOT SIGNING THE FORM.  PIONEER STATES THEY NOTIFIED MCARTHUR IN OCTOBER 2000 THAT THE FORM WAS NOT VALID.  HUNT'S ATTORNEY FOLLOWED UP WITH PIONEER AND WAS DENIED AGAIN.  HUNT'S ATTORNEY THEN APPROACHED HILLIARD LYONS IN OCTOBER 2005 TO REQUEST PAYMENT OF $63,979.80 TO HUNT.  CLAIM WAS DENIED AS THE ISSUE IS BETWEEN HUNT AND PIONEER."",
