  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Mr. Perkins vehemently denies any allegations of wrongdoing.  Mr. Perkins was not a party to the action and had no involvement in the Firm's decision to settle the matter.  The client was an extremely sophisticated investor with extensive financial sector experience who understood the risks associated with the investment strategies employed in her accounts.  It is Mr. Perkins' understanding that the matter was settled by the Firm for a portion of the alleged damages in order to avoid the costs and uncertainties of arbitration.""
