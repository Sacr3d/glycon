  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS TERMINATED IN JUNE 2010 BECAUSE A CUSTOMER ACCUSED ME OF MOVING HER SOCIAL SECURITY DEPOSIT ELECTRONICALLY TO CHASE BANK.  WHEN INITIALLY INVESTIGATED BY INTERNAL BANK SECURITY THE INVESTIGATOR TOLD ME THAT SHE BELIEVED MY DENIAL OF KNOWING THE CUSTOMER AND DELIBERATELY MOVING HER DEPOSIT OVER.  I HAD NEVER BEEN ACCUSED OF ANY TYPE OF ACTIVITY AS THIS BEFORE AS I HAVE A CLEAN WORK RECORD.  SO THE INVESTIGATOR SENT ME BACK TO WORK. IF INTERNAL SECURITY HAD BEEN CONVINCED THERE WAS A VIOLATION THEY COULD HAVE TERMINATED ME ON THE SPOT WITHOUT GOING BACK TO WORK.  IT WASN'T UNTIL 5 OR 6 WEEK LATER THAT I LEARNED THAT I WAS TO BE TERMINATED.  THE REASON GIVEN WAS THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS SO VEHEMENTLY REPEATEDLY CHARGED THAT HER IDENTITY HAS BEEN COMPROMISED THE MATTER COULD NOT BE CLOSED. THE MATER WAS THEN ESCALATED TO CORPORATE. THEY MADE THE DECISION TO TERMINATE, TAKING IT OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE BRANCH AND DISTRICT MANAGERS. I WAS NEVER GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THE CUSTOMER OR SPEAK TO HER.    THE MANAGER WHEN INFORMING ME OF THE TERMINATION HAS TEARS IN HER EYES, AND EVEN TOOK THE UNUSUAL STEP OF OFFERING TO BE A REFERENCE FOR ME. I KNOW THIS IS REALLY NOT DONE FOR TERMINATED EMPLOYEES.  I HAD PLANNED TO MAKE A CAREER WITH CHASE.  I WAS ENROLLED IN A DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR MY NEXT PROMOTION AS A BRANCH MANAGER.  I HAD ALSO BEEN RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE MOST OUTSTANDING BUSINESS BANKERS IN THE DISTRICT OPENING MORE ACCOUNTS AND GENERATING NEW REVENUE THAN MANY OF MY COLLEGES.""
