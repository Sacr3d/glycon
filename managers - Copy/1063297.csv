  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE IN THE SECURITIES BUSINESS.  MY PARTNER & I WERE ASKED TO BUY A FRANCHISE FROM A FIRM IN OHIO, BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT INDIVIDUALS COULD MAKE VIABLE INVESTMENTS AND AT THE SAME TIME CREATE TAX BENEFITS. WE HIRED AN ATTORNEY, FROM A WELL-KNOWN LAW FIRM, TO HELP US EVALUATE THE SITUATION.  AFTER THOROUGHLY EVALUATING THE OPPORTUNITY AND MAKING SEVERAL TRIPS TO OHIO, OUR ATTORNEY INFORMED US THAT HE FELT IT WAS A VIABLE INVESTMENT CONCEPT AND THAT IT WAS NOT A SECURITY. HE FURTHER SPECIFICALLY INFORMED US THAT NEITHER OUR FIRM OR OURSELVES NEEDED TO BE REGISTERED.  HE OBVIOUSLY MADE A MISTAKE, & AS A RESULT OF HIS ADVICE AND OUR INEXPERIENCE WE WERE IN ERROR.""
