  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THERE ARE NO PENALTIES, FINES, SUSPENSIONS, OR SETTLEMENT TERMS, AND CERTAINLY NO CHARGES. IN JANUARY 1992, I BORROWED $3000 FROM A CLIENT OF LONG STANDING, WHO MADE IT A PRACTICE OF LOANING MONEY TO PEOPLE (WITH INTEREST) AS A SIDELINE. I NEEDED THE MONEY TO RE-FINANCE MY MORTGAGE. WHEN THAT WAS COMPLETED (IN MID-APRIL), MY WIFE & I DEPOSITED A CHECK OF OVER $11,000 INTO A JOINT ACCOUNT. THE NEXT DAY, UNKNOWN TO ME, SHE NEARLY EMPTIED THE ACCOUNT, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO REPAY MY CLIENT WHEN I'D PROMISED HIM. HIS PATIENCE RAN OUT IN JUNE, WHEN HE COMPLAINED TO MY EMPLOYER (ADVEST). THEY THEN TOLD ME I'D BROKEN A HOUSE RULE AND MUST BE FIRED, THAT NO EXCEPTION COULD BE MADE. I'D FELT THAT THE LOAN WAS A PERSONAL MATTER, & OF COURSE STILL WILL RE-PAY THE MAN, BUT HE WAS ALSO A CLIENT. I WAS WRONG. COST ME MY JOB.""
