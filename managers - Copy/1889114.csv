IN 1992, THEY DEPOSITED $1,381,428, $1MM IN WHICH THEY INVESTED, AND THE REST THEY USED TO BUY A HOUSE AND MERCEDES.  OVER THE COURSE OF 8 YEARS (1994-2001) THE CUSTOMERS WITHDREW PVER $1.4 MM OR 100% OF ORIGINAL DEPOSIT.  AS OF 3/2000 THE ACCOUNTS STILL HAD A VALUE OF $800,000 DUE TO SUCCESSFUL INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS BY ME.  I HAD NUMEROUS DOCUMENTED MEETINGS IN REGARDS TO THE CUSTOMERS' SPENDING HABITS AND THE EFFECTS THEY WERE HAVING ON THEIR PORTFOLIO. EXHIBITS WERE USED TO SHOW THE MONEY WOULD RUN OUT AND I WORKED ONE ON ONE WITH THEIR CPA, [THIRD PARTY].  THEIR SPENDING HABITS CONTINUED. MERRILL LYNCH SENT LETTERS TO THE CUSTOMERS CONCERNING MARGIN, SUITABILITY STATUS ON FILE AND EVEN A SURVEY IN WHICH THEY RETURNED GIVING ME A 100%.  THIS SURVEY WAS TURNED IN MERELY 2 MONTHS BEFORE THE COMPLAINT WAS GIVEN.  I BELIEVE THAT THE COMPLAINT WAS A RESULT OF A MEETING I HAD IN MARCH WITH THE CUSTOMERS IN WHICH I STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT SPENDING SLOW DOWN.  BASICALLY, EVERYTHING WAS WONDERFUL FOR 8.5 YEARS BUT AS SOON AS THE MARKET DECLINED THE CLIENTS PANICKED AND FILED THIS COMPLAINT. MERRILL LYNCH BACKED ME 100% UNTIL DECISION WAS MADE TO SETTLE.""
