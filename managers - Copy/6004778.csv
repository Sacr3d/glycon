  ""Firm Name"" : ""CHARLES SCHWAB & CO., INC."",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Voluntary Resignation"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Allegations that the employee moved funds from a client's account to another account held by the same client without authorization."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""An existing elderly client came into the Saint Petersburg branch to open a managed account. He had difficulty using the laptop throughout the account opening process, so I assisted him, checking for his understanding throughout the entire process. After the account was opened, he instructed me to fund the account from his existing account.  A few months later, the client returned to the branch twice in one day and seemed confused about the status of his account. At that point, after reviewing the account history and at the client's request, we moved his funds out of the managed account. The matter was escalated internally to a group that supports elderly clients with suspected diminished capacity.   I believed that I was following the client's wishes throughout the whole process and would never intentionally act without authorization. I have always held the client's interest above any other factor and will continue to do so.""
