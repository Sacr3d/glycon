  ""Judgment/Lien Amount"" : ""$76,189.03"",
  ""Judgment/Lien Type"" : ""Tax"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""A payment plan had been established earlier in 2017 by Tracey and Michael DeCamillis to pay past taxes due that were listed under Tracey DeCamillis' social security number as the primary.   The payments made by Michael were mistakenly assigned to his social security number and his current taxes due as an employee of his LLC.  No payments were credited to the original payment plan and no notices were sent of the non-payment of the agreement that was under Tracey's name until the tax lien notice arrived on 11/11/17.  Michael, with the help of his CPA, established a new payment plan on 11/29/17 that will be directly debited from his checking account starting on 12/15/17.  The IRS agent said the Tax Lien will be removed within 90 days of the establishment of the new payment plan.""
