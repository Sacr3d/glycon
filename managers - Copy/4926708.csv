  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ITEM 1.  MY DAD AND I GOT INTO A PHYSICAL FIGHT WHEN I WAS 15. AS FAR AS I KNOW THE STATE AND DHR FILED CHARGES AGAINST THE BOTH OF US. I THINK HIS NOSE GOT BUSTED SO THEY TRIED TO MAKE IT AN AGGRAVATED ASSAULT, THUS PUSHING THE CASE TO FELONY STATUS. NEITHER OF US WERE PRESSING CHARGES AGAINST THE OTHER SO AFTER MANY COURT APPEARANCES THE CASE WAS 'NOLLE PROSSED'.  ITEM 2. I WAS HAVING A PARTY AT MY HOUSE WHEN I WAS 21 I GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH A FRIEND OF MINE. MY LIVE-IN GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME TRIED TO STOP ME FROM GOING AFTER HIM OUT THE DOOR WHERE SHE WAS KNOCKED DOWN IN THE CROWD OF PEOPLE TRYING TO STOP US. A BIG COMMOTION WAS MADE SO WHEN THE SHERRIFFS OFFICE ARRIVED, I WAS ARRESTED FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND RESISTING ARREST.  A POLICE REPORT STATED THAT I WAS CHASING AFTER MY GIRLFRIEND AND OTHERS WITH A KNIFE, WHICH NEVER HAPPENED.  THE ALLEGATIONS OF ME BEING IN ANY WAY VIOLENT TOWARDS MY GIRLFRIEND, WERE REFUTED IN OPEN COURT BEFORE THE JUDGE, BY THE ALLEGED VICTIM AND OTHERS.  THE TESTIMONY BEFORE THE JUDGE THAT FINALLY CLEARED MY NAME IN THIS INCIDENT WAS TAKEN IN A BRAND NEW MODERN COURTROOM OUTFITTED WITH DIGITAL RECORDING OF ALL OF THE PROCEEDINGS.  I HAVE MADE NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THAT COURT RECORDING BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TEXT TRANSCRIPTS, I WANTED TO HAVE THEM IN MY POSSESSION SOLELY FOR COMPLIANCE ISSUES.  I AM TOLD BY BREVARD CLERK'S OFFICE THAT THE RECORDING WAS TURNED OFF FOR THAT DAY. SO I GAVE UP ON FINDING THEM.  AS FOR THE RESISTING ARREST, I PLEADED NO CONTEST AND TOOK THE PROBATION JUST TO BE MOVING ON WITH MY LIFE.""
