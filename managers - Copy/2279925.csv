  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MY WIFE AND I AND TWO OTHER COUPLES WERE ATTENDING AN OUTDOOR BENEFIT CONCERT.  THE COUPLES WERE ALL SUCCESSFUL WORKING PROFESSIONALS IN THEIR LATE 30S TO EARLY 40S AND GOOD CITIZENS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOLS. OUR WIVES HAD ATTAINED PASSES TO A POST CONCERT EVENT WHERE THEY COULD ATTEND A MEET AND GREET OF THE PERFORMERS AND BE PRESENT AT A SIGNING OF AUTOGRAPHS AND PICTURES. WE HAD AGREED THAT THEY WOULD BE GONE 30 MINUTES.  AFTER ONE HOUR ELAPSED MYSELF AND THE OTHER HUSBANDS BECAME CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR WHEREABOUTS AND ASKED A YOUNG SECURITY GUARD (COLLEGE AGE) FOR HELP. HE REFUSED TO HELP IN ANY WAY. LATER, WE THEN SAW 2 TOUR BUSES LEAVE THE ARENA FOLLOWED BY A WAVE OF PEOPLE.  WHEN THEY STILL DID NOT APPEAR MY NEIGHBOR ASKED THE SECURITY GUARD FOR HELP AGAIN SAYING HOW GRAVELY CONCERNED WE WERE. HE REFUSED TO HELP AGAIN. HE WOULD NOT EVEN \""RADIO\"" FOR HELP OR TO MAKE AN INQUIRY. WHILE REFUSING TO HELP, THE SECURITY GUARD BEGAN AGGRESSIVELY PUSHING AND SHOVING MY NEIGHBOR, WHO WAS MUCH SMALLER IN STATURE (HE WEIGHS APPROX. 150LBS).  WHILE DOING SO, THE SECURITY GUARD WAS ALSO MAKING LUDE AND VERY DEROGATOEY REMARKS ABOUT OUR WIVES. CERTAIN THAT AN ALTERCATION WAS BREAKING OUT WITH THE MUCH LARGER SECURITY GUARD I INTERVENED AND CAME TO THE DEFENSE OF MY NEIGHBOR, STRIKING THE GUARD WITH A SINGLE THROWN PUNCH. THIS ACTION IS DEFENSABLE PURSUANT TO 2C:35-5 OF THE NEW JERSEY STATE CODE AS \""ACTING IN DEFENSE AND FOR PROTECTION OF ANOTHER\"".  AS CONFIDENT AS MY ATTORNEY, OUR WITNESSES AND I WERE ABOUT OUR DEFENSE, IN CONSIDERING THE EXPENSE OF TRIAL, THE UNFAVORABLE JURISDICTION BEING CAMDEN,NJ AND LOOKING AT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO, HOWEVER UNLIKELY, WE DECIDED THE MOST EXPEDIENT AND LOGICAL DECISION WAS TO ACCEPT THE PLEA OF $600 RESTITUTION AND 2 YRS. PROBATION PERIOD.""
