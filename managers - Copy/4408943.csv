  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS SITUATION DEVELOPED DURING MY FRESHMAN YEAR IN COLLEGE. AFTER CONSUMING ALCOHOL AT A PARTY A GROUP WENT TO 7-11 AND I LEFT THE STORE WITHOUT PAYING FOR A $4.00 BURRITO. I CHECKED ON THIS IN THE PAST AND WAS TOLD THAT NEITHER THE BEADLE COUNTY STATES ATTOURNEY'S OFFICE OF THE HURON POLICE DEPARTMENT HAVE RECORDS BACK TO 1983. A CLERK (MARILYN MCHENRY) AT THE BEADLE COUNTY COURTHOUSE WAS ABLE TO FIND THE DATE AND THE FINE AMOUNT BUT THAT WAS ABOUT ALL. THE PHONE NUMBER I HAD FOR HER WAS 605-353-7165""
