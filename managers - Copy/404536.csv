NO FORM WAS SENT AND SO I DID NOT PAY THE $125 FEE WHICH HAD BECOME DUE. I HAD FILED THE PROPER ADV-W FORM WITH THE S.E.C., WHICH WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY THAT OFFICE 1-7-92. I HAD INITIALLY REQUESTED THE PROPER FORM FROM BETTY JOE/DEPT. OF CORP.-CA  ON 12-13-91 AND DID NOT HEAR FROM HER AGAIN UNTIL RECEIVING HER 1-2-92 LETTER REGARDING THE PAST DUE RENEWAL FEE. I WROTE AND AGAIN REQUESTED A PROPER FORM FOR WITHDRAWAL. SHE RESPONDED WITH HER LETTER OF 2-7-92, WHICH WAS THE ORDER SUMMARILY REVOKING CERTIFICATE LETTER. SHE CLAIMS THIS IS NOW IRREVERSIBLE.""
