  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC ADMINISTRATIVE RELEASES 33-9081, 34-60936, IA 40-2945, INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 RELEASE 28989, NOVEMBER 4, 2009: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\""COMMISSION\"") DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 8A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (\""SECURITIES ACT\""), SECTIONS 15(B)(4), 15(B)(6) AND 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (\""EXCHANGE ACT\""), SECTIONS 203(E), 203(F) AND 203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 (\""ADVISERS ACT\"") AND SECTIONS 9(B) AND 9(F) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 (\""INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT\""), AGAINST DAVID HENIGSON (\""HENIGSON\"" OR \""RESPONDENT\"").  FROM 1988 TO NOVEMBER 2004, HENIGSON ENGAGED IN A FRAUDULENT PRACTICE THAT MISAPPROPRIATED ASSETS FROM MUTUAL FUNDS IN THE FORM OF INFLATED BROKERAGE COMMISSION PAYMENTS TO AN AFFILIATE BROKER-DEALER. DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD, THE PARENT COMPANY ENTERED INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH SEVERAL UNAFFILIATED BROKERAGE FIRMS TO EXECUTE, CLEAR AND SETTLE SECURITIES TRADES ON BEHALF OF THE FUNDS AT A DISCOUNTED COMMISSION RATE THAT VARIED DURING THE PERIOD FROM $.02 PER SHARE TO AS LOW AS $.01 PER SHARE. INSTEAD OF PASSING THIS DISCOUNT DIRECTLY TO THE FUNDS, THE RESPONDENTS ARRANGED FOR THE REBATE BROKERS TO CHARGE THE FUNDS A COMMISSION RATE OF $.0488 PER SHARE AND THEN TO \""REBATE\"" TO THE AFFILIATE BETWEEN $.0288 AND $.0388 PER SHARE, WHICH REPRESENTED BETWEEN 59% TO NEARLY 80% OF THE TOTAL COMMISSIONS. THE AFFILIATE, HOWEVER, DID NOT PROVIDE ANY BROKERAGE SERVICES TO THE FUNDS FOR THE COMMISSIONS IT RECEIVED ON THESE TRADES. IN TOTAL, THE PARENT DIRECTED OVER $24 MILLION OF THE FUNDS' ASSETS TO ITS AFFILIATED BROKER-DEALER, THE AFFILIATE, THROUGH THIS SO-CALLED \""COMMISSION RECAPTURE\"" PROGRAM. THE RESPONDENTS MISLED THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF THE FUNDS' BOARD OF DIRECTORS/TRUSTEES AND THE FUNDS' SHAREHOLDERS INTO BELIEVING THAT THE AFFILIATE PROVIDED BONA FIDE BROKERAGE SERVICES FOR THE FUNDS' SECURITIES TRADES WHEN, IN FACT, THE AFFILIATE DID NOT PROVIDE ANY SUCH SERVICES. RATHER, THE REBATE BROKERS PERFORMED THE NECESSARY BROKERAGE SERVICES, I.E., EXECUTION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT, FOR THE FUNDS' TRADES AND DID SO FOR AS LITTLE AS $.01 PER SHARE. THE RESPONDENTS ALSO FAILED TO DISCLOSE TO THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND THE FUNDS' SHAREHOLDERS THAT THEY REQUIRED THAT A TARGET PERCENTAGE - AS MUCH AS 70% OF THE FUNDS' TRADES IN SECURITIES LISTED ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, INC. (\""NYSE\"") - BE ALLOCATED TO THE RECAPTURE PROGRAM. THE TARGET TRADING PERCENTAGES SERVED TO UNDERMINE THE PARENT'S OBLIGATION TO SEEK \""BEST EXECUTION\"" FOR THE FUNDS' SECURITIES TRADES. THE RESPONDENTS ALSO MADE MATERIALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS ABOUT THE AFFILIATE AND THE RECAPTURE PROGRAM TO THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AT BOARD MEETINGS AND TO THE FUNDS' SHAREHOLDERS IN PUBLIC FILINGS WITH THE COMMISSION, INCLUDING IN THE FUNDS' REGISTRATION STATEMENTS. THE PARENT'S PRINCIPAL DISCUSSED THE PROGRAM PERIODICALLY WITH HENIGSON, WHO PERIODICALLY UPDATED HER ON THE AMOUNT OF COMMISSIONS BEING DIVERTED TO THE AFFILIATE. IN ADDITION, HENIGSON WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREPARING AND MAKING PRESENTATIONS TO THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS ABOUT WHY THE AFFILIATE WAS RECEIVING COMMISSION PAYMENTS FROM THE FUNDS, AND HE ALSO SIGNED CERTAIN COMMISSION FILINGS THAT MISCHARACTERIZED THE REASON WHY THE AFFILIATE WAS RECEIVING COMMISSION PAYMENTS FROM THE FUNDS."",
