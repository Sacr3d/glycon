  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS ON VACATION WITH MY IN LAWS ST PETERSBURGH. WE WENT OUT TO DINNER AT OCEAN PRIME WITH MY COUSIN AND HIS WIFE WHO LIVE IN TAMPA. AFTER DINNER WE HEADED OVER TO A MARTINI BAR.  IT WAS MY WIFE'S MOTHER AND FATHER ALONG WITH MY SISTER IN LAW AND BROTHER IN LAW AND COUSIN.  A GENTLEMAN KEPT APPROACHING MY WIFE AND THEN DECIDED TO SAY SOME THINGS TO MY WIFE DUE TO HER RESPONSE.  THE GENTLEMAN THEN RIPPED A STRAW OUT OF HER MOUTH AND THAT IS WHEN I GOT INVOLVED.  WE SCUFFLED ON THE GROUND BEFORE FAMILY MEMBERS AND STAFF BROKE IT UP.  HE WAS BLEADING FROM HIS FOREHEAD AND RECEIVED 3 STITCHES. --- ONLINE COURT RECORDS WERE INCORRECTLY SHOWING \""PLEAD TO LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE FOR PURPOSES OF PTI: FS. 784.041 1, F.T. BATTERY\"", WHICH PROMPTED FINRA TO RECOMMEND A \""YES\"" ANSWER TO QUESTION 14A1A, TO WHICH I COMPLIED.  HOWEVER, THE ONLINE COURT RECORDS HAVE BEEN CORRECTED AND NOW READ \""STATE REDUCE CHARGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PTI\"", AS I NEVER PLED GUILTY TO ANY CHARGES.  I AM NOW CHANGING MY ANSWER TO QUESTION 14A1A BACK TO \""NO\"", WHICH IS CORRECT.""
