  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I HAD INITIALLY MET WITH THE CLIENT IN MARCH, 2011 TO DISCUSS MOVING INDIVIDUAL STOCKS HELD IN CERTIFICATE FORM BY THE CLIENT'S DECEASED MOTHER, INTO AN ESTATE ACCOUNT.  THE CLIENT RETURNED APPROXIMATELY 2 WEEKS LATER, LETTING ME KNOW THE SPECIFIC COMPANIES AND NUMBER OF SHARES HELD.  THE CLIENT IS A MICHIGAN RESIDENT AND HAD JUST GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF OPENING AN ESTATE BANK ACCOUNT WITH PNC BANK WHILE HE WAS IN PITTSBURGH, WHERE HIS MOTHER RESIDED.  THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE EFFORT TAKEN GETTING THE NECESSARY COURT DOCUMENTS GIVEN THE PENNSYLVANIA RESIDENCY OF THE DECEASED, AND THAT THE CLIENT CHOSE TO OPEN THE ACCOUNT IN THE STATE OF MI RATHER THAN PA.  THIS DOCUMENT DELAY HAPPENED TO COINCIDE WITH A SIGNIFICANT MARKET DROP IN THE SPRING OF 2011, THUS CREATING A DROP IN SHARE PRICE FOR SOME OF THE POSITIONS.  AT NO TIME WAS THE CLIENT PROMISED A SPECIFIC TIME OF COMPLETION, AND IN FACT HE WAS MADE AWARE THAT THE PROCESS OF SETTLING AN ESTATE ACCOUNT, ESPECIALLY WHEN DEALING WITH COURTS OUT OF THE LOCAL AREA WOULD TAKE A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THAN ESTABLISHING A REGULAR ACCOUNT.""
