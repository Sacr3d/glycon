  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE NYS INSURANCE DEPARTMENT FINED ME IN 1992 $250.00 FOR \""UNINTENTIONALLY\"" SELLING HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE BY AN UNLICENSED CARRIER.  I WAS TOLD BY THE GENERAL AGENT THAT THE CARRIER WAS A BONAFIDE ERISA PLAN AND EXEMPT FROM STATE INSURANCE REGULATION, AND SO ADVISED BY THE SPONSERS.  THE STATE ACKNOWLEDGED THE SALE WAS UNINTIONAL AND THAT THIS CARRIER AFFECTED ROUGHLY 200 LIFE AGENTS IN NYS.  NO CLIENTS WERE INJURED AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO OTHER LITIGATION IS PENDING.""
