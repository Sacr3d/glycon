  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I was not made aware of that a lien would be filed.  I had an installment agreement that was in place to cover additional taxes due.  After submitting the installment agreement to the IRS, I received correspondence that everything was in order and if I needed to take additional action they would contact me.  The government shut down took place, I never heard from the IRS.  My installment agreement is up to date and I am in full compliance with the agreement.  The only correspondence I received was from the IRS a week and a half after the lien was filed.""
