  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS IS ALL BASED UPON NASTY AND BITTER POST-DIVORCE LITIGATION BETWEEN MY EX-WIFE, HER VERY WEALTHY PARENTS, AGAINST ME. THE OUTCOME OF THIS LOWER COURT JUDGMENT IS PENDING A DECISON IN THE 4TH DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL, CASE#: 10-1339 WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY FILED ON APRIL 2010. THIS AWARDED AMOUNT IS BEING CHALLENGED BY THE FORMER HUSBAND (ME) WHEN I WAS FOUND TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MY FORMER WIFE'S ATTORNEY FEES. THESE FEES AROSE WHEN THE FORMER HUSBAND REQUESTED A DOWNWARD MODIFICATION AND A REDUCTION OF HIS CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATION, DUE TO A DECREASE IN HIS INCOME - BASED UPON A DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY. HE WAS NOT ONLY DENIED HIS REQUESTED MODIFICATION, BUT THE COURT ACTUALLY GRANTED THE FORMER WIFE INCREASES SHE DIDN'T REQUEST OR PLEAD IN THE SUPPORT AMOUNT, AND THEN THE COURT ALSO FOUND ME TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HER ATTORNEY FEES. WE ARE AWAITING AN APPEAL COURT DECISION. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I DID TO PISS OFF THE LOWER COURT MAGISTRATE AND JUDGE...BUT WHATEVER I DO, THEY SEEM TO BE PUNISHING ME AND MAKING RULINGS ON MATTERS NOT REQUESTED OR PLEAD BY THE FORMER WIFE. IF I SHOULD LOSE MY APPEAL, I WILL BE ABLE TO PAY THIS AMOUNT OFF IN ONE LIUMP SUM WITH MONIES I RECEIVE AS PART OF AN INHERITANCE.""
