  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS DOING A FILE REVIEW FOR AN ASSIGNMENT THAT WAS 9 MONTHS OLD.  I NOTICED THAT MY MANAGER NEGLECTED TO SIGN ALL THE TRADING AUTHORIZATION FORMS AS REQUIRED BY INTERNAL AUDIT.  THERE WERE 13 PAGES AND SHE ONLY SIGED 9 OF THE DOCUMENTS.  SHE WAS ON VACATION SO I PHOTOCOPIED HER SIGNATURE FROM THE SIGNED DOCUMENTS TO THE UNSIGNED DOCUMENTS.  I FULLY DISCLOSED MY ACTIONS WHEN MY MANAGER RETURNED AND WE REPLACED THE COPIED SIGNATURES WITH HER ACTUAL SGINATURE.  THERE WERE NO ANCILLARY EFFECTS.""
