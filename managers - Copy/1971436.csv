  ""Broker Comment"" : ""OUR RECORDS INDICATE THE CLIENT HAD MULTIPLE MARGIN LOANS WITH OUR FIRM AND THE ORIGINAL LOAN BEGAN ON FEBRUARY 7, 1997.  ON THIS DATE, A CHECK WAS ISSUED TO THE CLIENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $25,000.  A CHECK IN THE AMOUNT OF $20,068.78 WAS ALSO ISSUED FROM MARGIN ON JUNE 10, 1997.  THE IR INDICATED WHEN THE CLIENT WOULD CALL TO PLACE A TRADE AND THE CLIENT WOULD STATE, \""I AM GOING TO PAY FOR THIS ONE,\"" MEANING THAT THE CLIENT WOULD BRING IN A CHECK RATHER THAN BUYING ON MARGIN, INDICATING THAT THE CLIENT WAS AWARE OF THE MARGIN ACCOUNT.  IN REGARDS TO THE DIVIDENDS PAID INTO HIS MARGIN ACCOUNT, IT APPEARS THE DIVIDENDS WERE REINVESTED.  ALL ACTIVITY WAS REFLECTED ON THE CLIENT'S CUSTOMER ACCOUNT STATEMENTS; THEREFORE, THE CLIENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE LOAN ACTIVITY OCCURRING IN THE ACCOUNT.  WHILE THE FIRM APPRECIATES THE CLIENT'S DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE DECLINE OF HIS VERISIGN STOCK, IT DOES APPEAR THE DECLINE IS A RESULT OF MARKET FLUCTUATION WHICH IS ONE OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OWNING ANY INVESTMENT.  ACCORDING TO THE IR, THE CLIENT DESIRED AN AGGRESSIVE INVESTMENT AND WANTED TO MAKE MONEY QUICKLY.  THE IR STATED SHE EXPLAINED THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TYPE OF INVESTING, AND THAT SHE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CLIENT REGARDING THE STOCK PRICE DECLINING AND HE INDICATED HIS DESIRE TO HOLD THE STOCK.  BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF OUR INVESTIGATION, WE WILL NOT BE MAKING AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNT. ""
