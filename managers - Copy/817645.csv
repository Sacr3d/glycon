  ""Allegations"" : ""IA Release 40-5194, March 11, 2019: The SEC deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 against Raymond Lawrence Lent (dba The Putney Financial Group, Registered Investment Advisors). In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer of Settlement, which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission's jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order. On the basis of this Order and Respondent's Offer, the Commission finds that these proceedings arise out of breaches of fiduciary duty and inadequate disclosures by registered investment adviser Raymond Lawrence Lent (dba The Putney Financial Group, Registered Investment Advisors) in connection with its mutual fund share class selection practices and the fees its affiliated broker and/or associated persons received pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\""12b-1 fees\""). At times during the period January 1, 2014 to June 7, 2018, Respondent purchased, recommended, or held for advisory clients mutual fund share classes that charged 12b-1 fees instead of lower-cost share classes of the same funds for which the clients were eligible. Respondent and its affiliated broker and/or its associated persons received 12b-1 fees in connection with these investments. Respondent failed to disclose in its Form ADV or otherwise the conflicts of interest related to (a) its receipt of 12b-1 fees, and/or (b) its selection of mutual fund share classes that pay such fees. During the Relevant Period, Respondent and its affiliated broker and/or associated persons received 12b-1 fees for advising clients to invest in or hold such mutual fund share classes. Respondent self-reported to the Commission the violations discussed in this Order pursuant to the Division of Enforcement's Share Class Selection Disclosure Initiative (\""SCSD Initiative\""). Accordingly, this Order and Respondent's Offer are based on the information self-reported by Respondent. As a result of this conduct, Respondent willfully violated Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act and willfully violated Section 207 of the Advisers Act."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Ray Lent, Putney Financial Group, responded to a self-reporting  SEC initiative to identify insufficiencies related to disclosures and procedures concerning Mutual Fund share class selections for clients.  Putney conducted a thorough review of its client's mutual fund holdings, disclosures and policies related to share class selection. The results concluded that Putney did not receive any payment for the 12b-1 fees that were identified under the initiative, although fees were paid to Affiliate Broker-Dealer, Portsmouth Financial from Putney Client Holdings.  Putney requested that Portsmouth refund any 12b-1 fees to the effected clients, including interest.  Putney reviewed it's required disclosures and internal policies, and updated the firm's Form ADV to include all relevant language related to the SEC's initiative.""
