  ""Broker Comment"" : ""SETTLED OUT OF COURT/MUTUAL CONSENT ORDER OF DISMISSAL (SETTLED FOR $10M) THE ORIGINAL SUIT WAS FILED IN AUG 88 AGAINST THE PRINCIPLES OF NORTHCUTT-OWEN & THE ATTYS WHO PERFORMED THE DILIGENCE ON THE AMERICAN HARVEST PROGRAM. I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY NAMED OVER 1 YR LATER AS HAVING SOLD THE PROGRAM.  THE MATTER WAS HANDLED BY MY ATTY JOHN HORNE.  THERE WERE NO DEPOSITIONS TAKEN OR STATEMENTS FROM ME EVER USED.  IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A NUISANCE LAWSUIT THAT DRAGGED ON AND ON.  AT NO TIME WAS I EVER SUSPENDED, REPRIMANDED OR EVEN ACCUSED BY MY CLIENTS OF WRONGDOING.  IT WAS TOTALLY WITHOUT MERIT. AT NO TIME WAS I EVER A PRINCIPLE AT NORTHCUTT-OWEN.""
