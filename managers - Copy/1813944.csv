  ""Broker Comment"" : ""On December 27, 2018 a criminal complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against John Riazzi.  The criminal complaint alleges that in July 2016 Mr. Riazzi violated various provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act in the renovation of a facility, specifically relating to the disposition of asbestos contained within the facility.  There has been no current disposition of the criminal complaint and Mr. Riazzi awaits his ability to contest these allegations in trial.  The alleged actions of Mr. Riazzi giving rise to the criminal complaint are not in any way related to Mr. Riazzi's duties, roles and responsibilities as a related person/investment adviser representative.""
