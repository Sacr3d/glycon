  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN AUGUST OF 1979 I WROTE A CHECK TO WINN DIXIE GROCERY FOR $84.96. DUE TO A MISCALCULATION IN MY PERSONAL CHECKBOOK THE CHECK WAS RETURNED INSUFFICENT. I WAS NOTIFIED OF THIS BY MAIL AND WENT TO THE WINN DIXIE STORE TO PICK UP THE CHECK. I WAS TOLD THAT THE CHEK HAD BEEN MISPLACED AND THAT I WOULD BE NOTIFIED WHEN IT WAS FOUND.  I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE EVENT. AT SOMEPOINT BETWEEN 8-79 AND 3/85 THE CHECK WAS FOUND AND TRANSFERRED TO WINN DIXIE REGIONAL OFFICE IN DALLAS,TX. AND WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE A WARRENT WAS ISSUED FOR MY ARREST. IN MARCH OF 1985 WHILE IN DALLAS,TX ON BUSINESS I WAS STOPPED BY A DALLAS POLICEMAN FOR MAKING AN ILLEGAL U TURN. A ROUTINE LICENSE CHECK REVEALED THE WARRENT AND I WAS ARRESTED. I SIMPLY PAID THE CHECK AND THE CASE WAS DISMISSED.""
