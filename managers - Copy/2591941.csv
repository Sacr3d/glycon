Contrary to the client's claim the accounts were appropriately allocated and had a net gain during her association with Compak Asset Management/William Bradley. The AAA Arbitrator ruled in favor of Compak Asset Management and ordered the Claimant to take nothing from the respondent. The respondent incurred the AAA arbitrator and administrative fees. Each party was responsible for their own attorney's fees.""
