  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The client opened an investment advisory account in which Mr. Zalewski has full trading discretion with the intent to engage in options trading, including written covered calls on an existing equity position. While the client complained about specific covered calls that lost money, the overall account gained in value from the time that the account was created. The trading in the account is consistent with the strategy that was discussed with the client at the account opening.""
