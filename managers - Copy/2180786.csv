16204,2180786,TIMOTHY,[TIM  BOYLE],BOYLE,3/1/2016,Employment Separation After Allegations,,"{
  ""Firm Name"" : ""Allstate Insurance Co"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Discharge after allegations of engaging in an outside business activity without providing written notice to the firm, and for allegations of violating the company's IT usage policy, code of ethics, and corporate credit card policy."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""After Finra's 9 month formal investigation, they found NO OBA activity,  NO violations of the company's IT usage policy and NO violations of the company Code of Ethics. This was an attempted attack on my Finra registration to keep me from competing with Allstate and recruiting their Financial Services Agents. Allegations regarding the Corporate Credit Card Policy: After Finra's 9 month formal investigation, they found that during the time period of 4/1/15, my Corporate Credit card was used for a personal expense. As a result of that, they issued my a letter of caution. I detailed the experience to Finra in great detail. Allstate hired a new secretary for me. She set up my Uber account on the Corporate Credit Card to cover my travel allowance. My personal Uber expenses were also charged to the Uber Account with my Corporate Credit Card on file. Once discovered, my assistant changed from the Corporate Credit card to my Personal Credit card and I wrote a check to Allstate to cover my personal expenses. There were no disciplinary measures taken on Allstate's behalf regarding this situation as it was a misunderstanding. Then, almost one year later, they mention it as a reason for termination. FINRA did not discipline me or FINE me. They wrote a letter of caution regarding the credit card issue only. During the 9 month FINRA investigation, FINRA reviewed 5 years of my emails, bank statements, texts, phone calls and concluded there was no evidence to support Allstate allegations. There was an immense amount of documentation and NO evidence to substantiate their claims.""
