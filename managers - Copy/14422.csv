  ""Broker Comment"" : ""AN AWARD OF $346,100 WAS GRANTED. [CUSTOMER] WAS A CLIENT FOR 12 YEARS. HE WAS FINANCIALLY SOPHISTICATED AND A SIGNIGICANT INVESTOR. HE REGRETTED INVESTING IN TAX SHELTERS (THE CORE OF HIS CLAIM) EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS HIS PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE ON HIS NEW ACCOUNT FORM. THROUGH INVESTING BASED ON MY RECOMMENDATIONS, [CUSTOMER'S] ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL STILL EXCEEDED THE RETIREMENT CAPITAL HE DESIRED. THIS WAS HIS INVESTMENT GOAL, WHICH HE HAD CALCULATED BY HIS CPA FIRM. HIS GOAL WAS ACHIEVED WITHOUT THE AWARD. A SUBSEQUENT HEARING BY THE ETHICS COMMITTEE OF THE CFP BOARD RESULTED IN THE CASE BEING DISMISSED \""AS IF IT WERE NEVER FILED.\""""
