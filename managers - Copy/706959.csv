  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Millis consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he recommended unsuitable short-term Class A mutual fund transactions to customers. The findings stated that although Millis understood that these mutual fund shares are long-term investments, he recommended the purchase and subsequent sale of the mutual fund shares after the customers held them for short periods. As a result of these short-term trades, the customers were charged approximately $174,725 in upfront sales charges. Half of the customers realized losses totaling approximately $33,391. Millis violated the reasonable-basis suitability obligation by recommending frequent trading in mutual funds without understanding the costs of those transactions. The findings also stated that Millis recommended an unsuitable switch from a variable annuity to Class A mutual fund shares to a senior customer that had significant expenses and short-term liquidity needs. Millis recommended that the customer liquidate the variable annuity, which resulted in a surrender charge of $14,866 and then immediately recommended the customer purchase the mutual fund shares, for which the customer was charged $15,340 in upfront sales charges. Millis violated the customer-specific suitability obligation because he did not have a reasonable basis to believe these recommended transactions were suitable for the customer."",
