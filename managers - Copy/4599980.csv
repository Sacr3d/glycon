  ""Allegations"" : ""[CUSTOMER] IS CLAIMING THAT I PROVIDED HIM ADVICE TO CONSOLIDATE HIS MONEY FROM THREE ACCOUNTS (401K & TRADITIONAL IRA) INTO A ROTH IRA IN SUMMER 2005.  ACCORDING TO [CUSTOMER], HE WAS SURPRISED WHEN HE HAD TO PAY TAXES UPON WITHDRAWING A PORTION OF HIS MONEY IN OCTOBER 2014.  [CUSTOMER'S] ACCUSATIONS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE FORMS THAT HE SIGNED SHOWING THAT ALL THREE ACCOUNTS WERE TO TRANSFERRED INTO TRADITIONAL IRAS.
