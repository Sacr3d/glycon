  ""Termination Type"" : ""Voluntary Resignation"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Associate was involved in facilitating the improper handling of trail commissions."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I RESIGNED FROM RAYMOND JAMES BECAUSE OF A REORGANIZATION. MY JOB TITLE AND CORE RESPONSIBILITIES WERE CHANGED. REGARDING THE \""IMPROPER HANDLING OF TRAIL COMMISSIONS\"" RELATES TO THE OPERATIONAL AND PAPERWORK CHALLENGES THAT OCCURRED DURING THE TRANSITION OF AN RIA TEAM MOVING INTERNALLY BETWEEN RAYMOND JAMES BROKER DEALER PLATFORMS. TRAIL COMMISSIONS EARNED BY THE RIA WERE NOT BEING PAID TO THE RIA BECAUSE PAPERWORK WAS NOT PROCESSED TIMELY OR CORRECTLY BY VARIOUS SUPPORT GROUPS. MY DIRECT REPORT AND RAYMOND JAMES OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT TEAMS WERE MADE AWARE OF THESE CHALLENGES AND WERE CONSULTED FOR GUIDANCE AND SOLUTIONS. IT WAS AGREED THAT A BUSINESS DECISION WOULD BE MADE TO PAY THE RIA THEIR EARNED TRAIL COMMISSIONS. NO OBJECTIONS WERE VOICED AT THE TIME THE REQUEST WAS MADE TO PAY THE RIA. I WAS NOTIFIED MORE THAN 6 MONTHS LATER THAT THE PAYMENT OF TRAIL COMMISSIONS TO THE RIA WERE REQUESTED AND PROCESSED INCORRECTLY.""
