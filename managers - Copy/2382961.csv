THE SEC ALLEGES THAT DENNIS CAUSED THE AFFILIATE AND HIS FIRM TO TRADE SECURITIES BASED ON NONPUBLIC INFORMATION IN ADVANCE OF AT LEAST TWO QUARTERLY EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENTS IN 2008 AND 2009. DENNIS ENABLED HEDGE FUNDS MANAGED BY HIS FIRM AND THE AFFILIATE TO GENERATE APPROXIMATELY $3.2 MILLION IN PROFITS AND AVOIDED LOSSES IN A STOCK.
