  ""Broker Comment"" : ""GJN (STRATS TRUST FOR JP MORGAN CHASE CAPITAL XVII SECURITIES, SERIES 2005-2) WAS AN RBC DAIN RAUSCHER SPONSORED SYNDICATE OFFERING THAT WAS SOLD TO THE CLIENT IN AUGUST 2005. I LEFT RBC IN AUGUST 2006. THE CLIENT MOVED HIS ACCOUNT IN APRIL 2008. GJN WAS CALLED IN JULY 2012, BASED ON A PROVISION IN THE DODD-FRANK LEGISLATION THAT CHANGED THE TREATMENT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL FOR THE ISSUER. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY INTERACTION WITH THE CLIENT OR GJN SINCE AUGUST 2006. GJN WAS TRADING NEAR THE OFFERING PRICE WHEN I LEFT.""
