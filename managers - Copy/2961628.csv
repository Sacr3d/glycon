  ""Allegations"" : ""On 5/4, BLC HR & Management interviewed Andrew due to a harassment claim against him. At the end of the interview, HR & management went over the retaliation policy with Andrew to reinforce not to retaliate against others for putting in the claim. The investigation was still ongoing. On 5/7, Andrew approached the person that voiced the complaint, asking her why she went to HR & said she shouldn't have done that. Management was made aware. On 5/9, Management asked Andrew if he was asking others about the Harassment claim. Andrew confirmed he did go to the person he thought might have filed the complaint. Andrew was terminated from BLC for violating the company's Retaliation Policy."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE ALLEGED INCIDENT NEVER HAPPENED. BANKERS LIFE AND I NEVER SAW EYE TO EYE WHEN IT CAME TO THE SALE OF ANNUITY PRODUCTS VERSUS TRADITIONAL INVESTMENTS. THE SALES AGENTS COMPLAINED BECAUSE THEY RECEIVED NO COMMISSION ON TRADITIONAL INVESTMENTS, ONLY A PORTION OF FIXED ANNUITY SALES. I REFUSED TO TOE THE COMPANY LINE IN MY REGION AND LEAD WITH ANNUITIES UNLESS THE SPECIFIC PRODUCT MET THE NEEDS AND WAS APPROPRIATE FOR MY CLIENTS.""
