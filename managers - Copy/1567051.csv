  ""Allegations"" : ""Litigation Release No. 23922 / August 28, 2017:  The Securities and Exchange Commission (\""Commission\"") alleges that this matter involves an offering fraud orchestrated by Defendant Dawn J. Bennett (\""Bennett\""), founder and owner of Defendant DJB Holdings, LLC (\""DJBennett\""), a Washington D.C.-  based retail sports apparel business.   From December 2014 through at least July 2017, Defendants raised more than $20 million from at least 46 investors through the unregistered offering of DJBennett convertible and promissory notes (collectively, the \""Notes\"") by making materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things, DJBennett's financial condition and operating performance, the risks associated with the investment, and the intended use of investor proceeds.   Bennett, a former registered representative associated with Broker Dealer 1, and former radio host of \""Financial Myth Busting with Dawn Bennett,\"" for years operated a financial advisory business. By the outset of the fraud, however, Bennett had lost a significant portion of her financial advisory clientele and DJBennett was not profitable. As her financial condition rapidly deteriorated, Bennett began accumulating a variety of personal financial obligations, but nonetheless continued to spend considerable sums to fund her extravagant life style.   To finance DJBennett, Bennett turned to the fraudulent sale of the Notes. Bennett largely targeted elderly and financially unsophisticated investors by materially misrepresenting the company's profitability and by claiming the company had the resources to pay annual rates of return as high as 15%. Bennett also lied about DJBennett's extensive liabilities and the risks associated with the investment. Although Bennett claimed the funds would be used for corporate purposes, she used the proceeds for a variety of improper purposes, including payments to earlier investors in the nature of Ponzi scheme, to service debt, and a variety of luxuries, such as jewelry, high-end clothing, mystics, and a $500,000 annual lease for a luxury suite at AT&T Stadium in Dallas.   Bennett also employed a variety of other fraudulent devices to further the scheme and to avoid detection. Among other things, Bennett lied to Broker Dealer 1 and a regulator about her ongoing note sales; fraudulently obtained several loans by submitting fabricated brokerage statements that inflated her net worth and then used the proceeds, in part, to make interest and redemption payments; and replaced previously sold convertible notes with nine-month promissory notes in an apparent attempt to have the promissory notes deemed loans.   As a result of the conduct described, Defendants violated, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\""Securities Act\"") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\""Exchange Act\"") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder."",

  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Admin Release 33-9910/34-75864/IA Release 4191/Investment Company Act Release 31810/September 9, 2015: The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Sections 203(e), 203(f), and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act) against Dawn J. Bennett. From at least 2009 through February 2011, a firm and its founder, majority owner, and CEO, Bennett, made material misstatements and omissions regarding assets that were purportedly \""managed\"" for investors and regarding investment returns for the purpose of retaining existing customers and attracting new customers. Then, during the investigation of this matter, Bennett and the firm made additional misstatements in an effort to obstruct the investigation and to \""cover up\"" their prior fraud. In short, Bennett and the firm grossly overstated the amount of assets they \""managed,\"" by at least $1.5 billion, in a calculated effort to inflate their profile and prestige. They made the false and fraudulent claims to a national financial advisor ranking service knowing that the ranking service would publish the misstatements. They also made the misstatements on a Washington, D.C.-area radio program hosted by Bennett, and in a variety of other advertisements and communications with existing and prospective customers and clients. The purpose of these overstatements was to create the impression that Bennett and her firm were larger and more successful players in the industry than they were. Bennett and the firm also made material misstatements and omissions during the radio show regarding the firm's investment returns and performance. Bennett frequently touted her firm's highly profitable investment returns and claimed that those returns placed the firm in the \""top 1%\"" of firms worldwide. In violation of her legal disclosure duties and specific advice she received, Bennett failed to disclose that the purported \""returns\"" were simply those of a \""model portfolio\"" and did not reflect actual customer returns. In addition to the material misstatements and omissions about these matters, Bennett and the firm failed to adopt and to implement adequate written policies and procedures related to the calculation and advertisement of assets managed and of investment returns. During the investigation of this matter, in order to substantiate their prior fraudulent claims regarding assets managed and to obstruct this investigation, Bennett and the firm made additional false statements. They falsely asserted that they gave advice regarding short-term cash management to three corporate clients regarding over $1.5 billion in corporate assets. In reality, they never provided the advice, and these were simply lies meant to deceive the Division of Enforcement. Bennett and the firm never provided any form of management for assets in excess of approximately $407 million. As a result of the conduct described above, Bennett willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act. Bennett willfully aided and abetted and caused the firm's violations of, Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rules 206(4)-1(a)(5) and 206(4)-7 thereunder."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Bennett Group Financial Services (\""BGFS\"") and Dawn Bennett, despite facts to the contrary, were recently charged by the SEC with misrepresenting the amount of \""assets under management\"" and the results of their investment model used to make recommendations to their to brokerage clients. The reputed misstatements are said to have occurred almost five years ago in statements made on Ms. Bennett's syndicated radio show, \""Financial Mythbusting,\"" in which Ms. Bennett and her guests debate government economic policies, and in a publication in 2009 and 2011.   Critically, despite over four years of investigation, the SEC did not charge that customers of BGFS lost money due to any misconduct on the part of Ms. Bennett or BGFS.   Ms. Bennett and her colleagues at BGFS have acted with integrity in building their company. Their business model is based on the integrity of the markets and the need for financial advisors to abide by conduct consistent with just and equitable principles of trade.  Litigation will demonstrate that the SEC's allegations against Bennett and her firm are without merit.   Consequently, Ms. Bennett denies all allegations of any wrongdoing. She will vigorously defend this case at the earliest possible moment, but in the proper forum. When all facts come to light, not just those the SEC chooses to focus on, Ms. Bennett anticipates she will be completely vindicated.""
