  ""Initiated By"" : ""UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC ADMINISTRATIVE RELEASE IA 40-2289; INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT RELEASE 40-26589, AUGUST 30, 2004: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\""COMMISSION\"") DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 203(F) AND 203(K) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 (\""ADVISERS ACT\"") AND SECTIONS 9(B) AND 9(F) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 (\""INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT\"") AGAINST TIMOTHY J. MILLER (\""RESPONDENT\"" OR \""MILLER\""). THIS IS A PROCEEDING AGAINST TIMOTHY J. MILLER, BASED ON HIS ROLE IN ASSISTING HIS FIRM IN APPROVING MARKET TIMING AGREEMENTS FROM 2001 THROUGH JULY 2003 (THE \""RELEVANT TIME PERIOD\""). BY ENTERING INTO THESE AGREEMENTS THE FIRM BREACHED ITS FIDUCIARY DUTY TO THE FUNDS. THE AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTRAVENED THE FUNDS' PROSPECTUS DISCLOSURES. MARKET TIMING INCLUDES (A) FREQUENT BUYING AND SELLING OF SHARES OF THE SAME MUTUAL FUND OR (B) BUYING OR SELLING MUTUAL FUND SHARES IN ORDER TO EXPLOIT INEFFICIENCIES IN MUTUAL FUND PRICING. MARKET TIMING, WHILE NOT ILLEGAL PER SE, CAN HARM OTHER MUTUAL FUND SHAREHOLDERS BECAUSE IT CAN DILUTE THE VALUE OF THEIR SHARES, IF THE MARKET TIMER IS EXPLOITING PRICING INEFFICIENCIES, OR DISRUPT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE MUTUAL FUND'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND CAN CAUSE THE TARGETED MUTUAL FUND TO INCUR COSTS BORNE BY OTHER SHAREHOLDERS TO ACCOMMODATE FREQUENT BUYING AND SELLING OF SHARES BY THE MARKET TIMER. UNDER THE MARKET TIMING AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM, THROUGH MILLER AND OTHERS, PERMITTED CERTAIN SELECT INVESTORS (\""MARKET TIMERS\"") TO MAKE EXCESSIVE EXCHANGES AND REDEMPTIONS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $ 58 BILLION IN SELECT FUNDS. THE FIRM REQUIRED, EITHER EXPRESSLY OR TACITLY, THE MARKET TIMERS' INVESTMENT OF \""STICKY ASSETS\"" IN FUNDS (I.E., LONG-TERM MONEY THAT WOULD REMAIN IN A PARTICULAR FUND WITHOUT BEING ACTIVELY TRADED) UNDER SOME OF THE AGREEMENTS. THE MARKET TIMING AGREEMENTS FINANCIALLY BENEFITED THE FIRM IN THAT IT REALIZED ADDITIONAL ADVISORY FEES FROM THE TIMED FUNDS AND STICKY ASSETS UNDER ITS MANAGEMENT. BECAUSE IT HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE ASSETS BROUGHT TO THE FUNDS UNDER THE MARKET TIMING AGREEMENTS, WHILE SERVING TO INCREASE THE FIRM'S ADVISORY FEES, COULD BE TRADED IN A MANNER DETRIMENTAL TO THE FUNDS, IT HAD A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH THE FUNDS. THE FIRM FAILED TO DISCLOSE THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FUNDS OR TO THE FUND SHAREHOLDERS AND OBTAIN THE BOARD MEMBERS' CONSENT TO THE AGREEMENTS, THEREBY BREACHING ITS FIDUCIARY DUTY TO THE FUNDS. THE MARKET TIMING AGREEMENTS WERE ALSO INCONSISTENT WITH THE DISCLOSURES MADE IN THE FUNDS' PROSPECTUSES. THE PROSPECTUSES STATED THAT SHAREHOLDERS COULD MAKE UP TO FOUR EXCHANGES OUT OF EACH FUND PER TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD. THE MARKET TIMING AGREEMENTS PROVIDED FOR MORE THAN THE DISCLOSED NUMBER OF EXCHANGES. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THE PROSPECTUSES ALSO DISCLOSED THAT EACH FUND RESERVED THE RIGHT TO MODIFY THE EXCHANGE POLICY IF SUCH A MODIFICATION WAS DETERMINED TO BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE FUND, THE FIRM FAILED TO MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT EACH PROPOSED MARKET TIMING AGREEMENT WAS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE FUND BEFORE ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT. IN THE AGGREGATE, THE MARKET TIMING TRADES MADE UNDER THE AGREEMENTS WERE DETRIMENTAL TO THE FUNDS' SHAREHOLDERS."",
