  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS THE CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER FOR THIS FIRM AND RELIED ON THE OSJ MANAGER WHO WAS DESIGNATED WITH THE SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITES. HE WAS NOT NAMED IN THIS ACTION ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT FULFILL HIS SUPERVISORY OBLIGATIONS. ALL OF THESE ACTIONS OCCURED IN AN OSJ OF THE FIRM WHERE REGISTERED PRINCIPALS WERE DESIGNATED THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPERVISE THESE ACTIONS. FOR THE RECORD, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN ANY MARKET ADVANTAGE IN THE AREAS OF MARKET MAKING AND ISSUANCE OF RESEARCH REPORTS. THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION, APPX $6000 AND THE SUBSEQUENT PROFIT OF $400 CORROBORATE THIS POINT. THE TRANSACTION PRICE FOR THE SALES IN  QUESTION $2.7662/SH AND CLOSING PRICE FOR THE STOCK $2.70/SH SUGGEST THAT THE RESEARCH REPORT HAD ALMOST NO EFFECT ON THE MARKET AND WAS NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT. THE TRANSACTION IN QUESTION ALSO ONLY ACCOUNTED FOR APPX 1/10 OF 1 % OF MARKET VOLUME FOR THE DAY.""
