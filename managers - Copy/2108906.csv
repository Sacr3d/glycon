  ""Firm Name"" : ""RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, INC."",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""CONCERNS OVER FINANCIAL ADVISOR'S SOLICITATION OF A CLIENT IN AN ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT PRODUCT AND HIS RESUBMISSION OF AN INVESTOR QUALIFICATION FORM THAT WAS MODIFIED AFTER THE FORM HAD BEEN SIGNED."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This client has been a personal friend of mine for 40 years. We discussed adding a \""fund of funds\"" placement as a relatively small component of his portfolio. We completed the initial investor questionnaire, primarily referencing his assets held by Raymond James. After submitting the signed document to operations, I was told a few days later that the investment was limited to investors with greater assets. I called my client and told him that he did not qualify. On that phone call he volunteered information about other assets that were not held by Raymond James. I copied the initial questionnaire form, added the client's additional asset information to the copy, and then delivered both the initial form and the copy to operations, specifically explaining what I had done and specifically asking if the form appeared to be in order. Raymond James took and presumably processed the questionnaire without raising a single question or comment to me, either then or any time after. I was never contacted by anybody from compliance or management before being summarily terminated without warning some weeks later. The client subsequently provided Raymond James with a sworn affidavit confirming that we in fact discussed his additional assets after I called to tell him that he apparently would not qualify. Notwithstanding Raymond James' disproportionate treatment of me, the customer remains satisfied with the initial recommendation. In my opinion, it was simply easier for Raymond James to terminate me and willfully ignore the actual facts, rather than having to explain why operations, compliance, and branch management evidently processed the information after I specifically explained the changes and after I specifically asked if the documents were in order.""
