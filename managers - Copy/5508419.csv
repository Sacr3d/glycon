  ""Firm Name"" : ""VALIC FINANCIAL ADVISORS, INC"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Registrant terminated following determination that he (i) violated the firm's information and document integrity policy through the use of correction fluid ('white-out') to alter a document previously signed by a firm client, and (ii) provided inconsistent explanations to the firm in connection with its review of the matter."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Paperwork was completed with client to rollover funds into an IRA with firm.  Several days following the meeting client called stating she changed her mind and wanted to split the amount into two rollovers.  At the second appt I informed the client that several of the forms were the same as those just completed.  In the presence of the client white out was used to reflect the amount she was now requesting to rollover to a second IRA.  Paperwork was submitted to firm, approved by Firm's Compliance Officer and letter of acceptance was sent.  A statement was provided to firm upon request detailing the transactions and the use of the white out.  No inconsistency was communicated to me when statement was reviewed with Management or information provided at time of termination.""
