  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This is a continuation of Occurrence #1733832 of an amount of $77,647.94. Ms. Loughery hired an attorney to contend with the IRS that the original amount could be written off in a lump sum rather than as $3000 per year. The IRS agreed. Now she is on a payment plan with the IRS for the remainder of the amounts.""

HOWEVER, WE FOUND OUT AFTER THE FACT, YOU CAN WRITE OFF $3000 PER YEAR. INCLUDING INTEREST, WE HAD PLANNED ON WRITING OFF ABOUT $72,000, AND DID NOT PAY TAX ON THAT AMOUNT OF INCOME THAT YEAR. PAT WAS OUT OF WORK FOR A YEAR, AND THIS SNOWBALLED. ON PAYMENT PLAN WITH IRS NOW.""
