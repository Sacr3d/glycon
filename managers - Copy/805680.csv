  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I vehemently deny any wrongdoing and assert that the allegations are completely without merit.  The investment about which the investors have complained was suitable and was recommended based on the customers' objectives, goals, net worth and financial circumstances and were recommended only after 5 meetings of discussion and detailed review of all material documentation related to the investment.  The investors are very wealthy and this investment comprised approximately 0.02% of the wealth investors' net worth.  Moreover, they have a background in the same industry as the investment of which they now complain.  The investors confirmed in writing that they not only received the requisite investment documentation/disclosures, but that they fully understood the characteristics and risks of the investments, both by way of the materials, but also in documented conversations with myself and by way of their background in building their net worth.  In their complaint, the investors cherry-picked the one investment that has not performed as well as they would have liked, but ignore that their other investments have performed well.  At all times, I put the customers' interests first and I will vigorously defend this matter to the fullest extent of the law""
