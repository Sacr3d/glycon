  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I HAVE REVIEWED ALL PERTINENT INFO REGARDING TEH CLIENT'S CLAIM.  CLIENT NEVER ASKED TO SELL POSITIONS AS ASSERTED IN SUGGESTION THAT B SHARE CDSC WAS NOT DISCLOSED.  MY DISCUSSION WITH CLIENT AT TIME OF RECOMMENDATION WAS THE ABILITY TO MOVE TO OTHER PORTFOLIO STYLES WITHOUT CHARGE IN THAT FAMILY.  THIS INCLUDED AETNA (NOW ING).  FOLLOW UP CONVERSATIONS WITH CLIENT DEALT WITH MARKET VOLITILITY AND FUND PERFORMANCE.  ONLY NOW ARE THE DISCLOSURE ISSUES BEING SUGGESTED.  IT IS NOT MENTIONED BY CLIENT THAT ON MY LAST ATTEMPT TO REVIEW WITH HER, SHE REFUSED THE MEETING STATING, \""SHE JUST WANTED ME TO FIX IT.\""  I FEEL THAT CLIENT WAS GIVEN A FULL DISCUSSION AT TIME OF INVESTMENT TO ALL REQUIRED AND PERTINENT FACTS.  IT IS UNFORTUNATE TO HAVE HAD THE SERIES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET TURMOIL, BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN SHE WAS NOT GIVEN THE FULL PICTURE.""
