  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS 23 YEARS TURNING 24 YEARS OLD WHEN I STARTED TO STRUGGLE WITH THE PAYMENTS.  I'VE ACCRUED THIS AMOUNT OF DEBT BECAUSE OF A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF INCOME DUE TO THE ECONOMY WHILE HELPING MY FAMILY PAY FOR LIVING COSTS.  I HAD NO MONEY MANAGEMENT SKILLS AND I WAS REALLY BEHIND IN PAYMENTS, SO I DECIDED TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT AFTER BEING HIRED BY COMCAST CABLE.  I DECIDED TO CALL THE LENDER AND ASKED FOR SOME ASSISTANCE.  LUCKILY, THE LENDER GAVE ME A FEW MONTHS TO MAKE THIS PAYMENT.  I AM IN GOOD STANDING WITH THIS LENDER TODAY.""
