  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN SEPTEMBER 2002, A CLIENT AND CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE PROVIDED INSTRUCTIONS TO LIQUIDATE HER ACCOUNT. DUE TO A SERIES OF UNFORSEEN EVENTS, THERE WAS A SHORT DELY IN THE EXECUTION OF THE LIQUIDATION RESULTING IN A SLIGHT REDUCTION IN PROCEEDS.  IN ORDER TO AVOID ANY BAD FEELINGS AND HARM TO OUR FRIENDSHIP, I WROTE THE FRIEND A PERSONAL CHECK FOR $7500.  AT THE TIME, IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME THAT THIS PAYMENT MIGHT BE VIEWED AS INAPPROPRIATE. INDEED, I FREELY DISCLOSED MY ACTION TO NUMEROUS CO-WORKERS AND SUPERIORS.""
