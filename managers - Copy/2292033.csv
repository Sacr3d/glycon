  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I DENY THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS COMPLAINT.  THE CLIENT AND I WORKED TOGETHER FOR APPROXIMATELY NINE YEARS, AND HE WAS PLEASED WITH BOTH HIS PORTFOLIO AND OUR WORKING RELATIONSHIP, THAT, AS I WAS PROMOTED WITHIN THE COMPANY, HE TRANSFERRED HIS ACCOUNTS SO THAT I COULD REMAIN HIS FINANCIAL CONSULTANT.  AS A RESULT OF THIS RELATIONSHIP, THE CLIENT ESTABLISHED A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF FUNDS THAT INCLUDED MANY DIFFERENT EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME COMPONENTS.  OVER THE YEARS, WE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF NOT ONLY THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO, BUT ALSO THE INDIVIDUAL FUNDS.  WITH REGARD TO THIS SPECIFIC FUND, THE INITIAL INVESTMENT WAS MADE NEARLY EIGHT YEARS AGO.  IN ADDITION, THE CLIENT ALSO MADE TWO SUBSEQUENT INVESTMENTS.  AT THE TIME OF THE THIS INVESTMENT, THE CLIENT HAD A DESIRE FOR A HIGH LEVEL OF MONTHLY INCOME.  VARIOUS FUNDS WERE CONSIDERED, BUT IN KEEPING WITH HIS DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO, IT WAS DECIDED THAT THIS FUND BEST MET HIS NEEDS.  I AM NOT CLEAR AS TO THE BASIS OF THIS COMPLAINT, AND HOW THE CLIENT IS CALCULATING A LOSS FOR THIS FUND AS HE HAS RECEIVED A VERY HIGH MONTHLY INCOME STREAM THAT HAS SUPPORTED HIS RETIREMENT FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.  I HAVE NOT BEEN HIS FINANCIAL CONSULTANT FOR OVER THREE AND A HALF YEARS SINCE I LEFT FIRSTAR INVESTMENTS AND I CANNOT COMMENT ON ANY CHANGES THAT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED IN HIS INVESTMENT PROFILE SINCE WE LAST SPOKE.""

THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED THE SAME COLLEGE YEAR AS THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED INCIDENT. I AND 4 ROOMMATES WERE OUT HUNTING ON SOME WOODS OUTSIDE OF AMES, IA, ON OUR WAY BACK TO THE TRUCK WE CUT DOWN A SMALL PINE TREE TO USE AS A CHRISTMAS TREE. AS IT ENDED UP, THE FARMER WHO OWNED THE LAND WAS ORIGINALLY UPSET AND PRESSED CHARGES ON US. ONCE WE PAID HIM FOR A REPLACEMENT TREE, HE DROPPED THE CHARGES.""
