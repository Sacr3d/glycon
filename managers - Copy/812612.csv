  ""Initiated By"" : ""UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""The Securities and Exchange Commission (the \""Commission\""), for its Complaint against Chris A. Dantin (CA Dantin) and Christopher D. Dantin (CD Dantin), alleges that they served as unregistered brokers on behalf of a South Florida merchant cash advance company. During that time, CD Dantin raised more than $8 million for the company from the offer and sale of securities in unregistered transactions to numerous investors in Louisiana and Texas in at least 175 transactions. CD Dantin earned more than $2 million in transaction-based commissions from his own sales and renewals and from sales of 15 additional sales agents whom he referred to the company. CA Dantin earned more than $270,000 in commissions from sales of more than $3 million in approximately 35 transactions, plus commissions from renewals. The company marketed its investment as a safe and secure alternative to  the stock market and baselessly claimed that investing in its merchant cash advance business would achieve high single-digit or low double-digit annual returns. Like other company sales agents, the Dantins' repeated those claims to prospective investors. They also repeated the company's false assertions that its notes were not securities. Unbeknownst to the Dantins' and their clients, many of whom invested their retirement savings, the company's business was a fraud. The company and its chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) were misrepresenting how they were using investor money, syphoning off millions in investor funds to fund the CEO's luxury lifestyle and operate unrelated businesses. The company's business came to a crashing halt when it filed for bankruptcy, leaving many of the Dantins' customers and thousands of other investors with hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. During the time they offered and sold the company's securities, the Dantins were not registered as broker-dealers with the Commission or associated with a registered broker-dealer. In addition, the company did not register its securities offering with the Commission, and there was no applicable exemption from registration for this offering. By engaging in this conduct, the Dantins' each violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\""Securities Act\""), and Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\""Exchange Act\""). The Commission seeks injunctions against both Dantins from future violations of these provisions, as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest on disgorgement, and civil money penalties against both."",
