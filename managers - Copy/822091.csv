  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The clients were referred to us by their CPA and became clients in 2010. At that time, both I and my now retired partner that I had worked with, met with them on numerous occasions upon which they purchased several annuities and discussed other considerations all suitable for their ages at the time and all conservative in nature.  We recommended that they meet with an Attorney who specialized in Elder Care Law as well. They chose the attorney.  All disclosures and suitability documents that were required at the time were provided, explained and signed for by the client.  Subsequently the client moved their accounts to an advisor that the Elder Care Attorney referred them to at another firm. I have had a clean record since entering the business in 1975 and I find it interesting that a claim is being filed especially after such a long period of time which will now be a permanent part of my record.""
