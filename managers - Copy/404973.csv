  ""Broker Comment"" : ""A COMPLAINT FILED BY [FAMILY MEMBER], EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE OF [CUSTOMER], AGAINST WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY (FIRM) AND DONALD J. ROSS (RESPONDENT), WAS SETTLED IN AN NASD ARBITRATION IN THE AMOUNT OF $25,000.00. THE FIRM PROPOSED THAT THIS JUDGEMENT BE SHARED EQUALLY ($12,500.00 EACH) BY BLAIR AND THE RESPONDENT (DONALD ROSS). IT WAS ROSS'S CONTENTION THAT SUCH A SHARING ARRANGEMENT DID NOT ADEQUATELY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE FACTS SUPPORTING ROSS'S PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT IN THIS ARBITRATION, AND THEREFORE, ROSS REQUESTED THAT HE BE PERMITTED TO PERSONALLY SATISFY THE ENTIRE JUDGEMENT IF IT WAS BELIEVED BY THE FIRM THAT ROSS WAS IN ANY WAY CULPABLE. CRITICAL TO ROSS'S OFFER WAS HIS UNQUESTIONABLE BELIEF THAT HE PERSONALLY HAD NOTHING TO WARRANT ANY JUDGEMENT AGAINST BLAIR AND HIMSELF, AND ROSS THEREFORE DID NOT BELIEVE IT WAS APPROPRIATE THAT BLAIR SHOULD SHARE FINANCIALLY TO ANY EXTENT IF THE FIRM BELIEVED THAT ROSS ACTED IMPROPERLY. AFTER DELIBERATION, BLAIR NEVERTHELESS ELECTED TO GO WITH ITS ORIGINAL PROPOSAL OF EQUAL SHARING, BECAUSE IT WAS AGREED THAT SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT FOR SHARING OF THE LIABILITY WAS THE MOST APPROPRIATE SOLUTION TO THIS MATTER. A COPY OF THE ABOVE REFERENCE COMPLAINT BY [FAMILY MEMBER] FILED ON AUGUST 7, 1986 ALLEGING UNSUITABILITY AND MISREPRESENTATION IN THE PURCHASE OF COLECO COMMON STOCK. [CUSTOMER] HAD REQUESTED, BECAUSE OF HIS FAILING HEALTH THAT ROSS PURCHASE INVESTMENTS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF GENERATING INCOME FROM SAFE, CONSERVATIVE SOURCES. ROSS FAILED TO DISCLOSE BOTH THE RISKS INVOLVED IN SELLING UNCOVERED OPTIONS AND THE RISKS OF PURCHASING AN EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND SPECULATIVE STOCK SUCH AS COLECO. AS A DIRECT AND PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THE CONDUCT OF BLAIR AND ROSS, CLAIMANT'S DECEDENT ([FAMILY MEMBER]) SUBSTAINED LOSSES IN THE AMOUN*SEE FAQ #1*""
