  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MY SON WAS A COLLEGE STUDENT AND IN NEED OF STUDENT LOANS TO CONTINUE HIS EDUCATION. AS A STUDENT HE WAS UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE STUDENT LOANS ON HIS OWN FINANCIAL STRENGTH SO I AGREED TO BE A CO-SIGNER. I BECAME AWARE THAT THE STUDENT LOANS WERE IN DEFAULT AND PLACED IN COLLECTION IN MARCH 2013 WHEN I RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION FROM THE COLLECTION COMPANY. I WAS UNAWARE THAT THE COMPROMISE MUST BE DISCLOSED SINCE THE STUDENT LOANS WERE MY SON'S.   I NEGOTIATED A COMPROMISE WITH THE LENDER BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO ASSIST MY SON FINANCIALLY. MY SON DOES NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO PAY THE STUDENT LOANS SO AS A PARENT I PAID OFF THE STUDENT LOANS. I DID NOT REPORT THE DISCLOSURE TO MY OSJ OR BROKER DEALER BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE LOANS BELONGING TO MY SON.   THE STUDENT LOAN WAS SATISFIED IN FOUR (4) INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS FOR A TOTAL $8620.00. THE ORIGINAL STUDENT LOAN WAS $17,366.00. ONCE AGAIN I WAS NOT ATTEMPTING TO HIDE THE COMPROMISE, I SIMPLY WAS NOT AWARE THAT MY SON'S STUDENT LOANS WERE REPORTABLE. I NOW REALIZE THAT BECAUSE I AM A FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL AND CO-SIGNER THAT THE STUDENT LOANS MUST BE DISCLOSED ON 14K (1) ON MY FORM U-4 AND SHALL AMEND MY FORM U-4 IMMEDIATELY.""
