  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I SUBLEASED MY APARTMENT TO RENT A BIGGER APARTMENT DUE TO MOVING WITH FIANCE.  THE TENANT LIVING IN THE APARTMENT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION TO MOVE OUT AND DID NOT CONTACT ME.  I APPLIED FOR A MORTGAGE AND FOUND THAT THE APARTMENT COMPLEX (LANDSTAR INC.) HAD A JUDGEMENT AGAINST ME.  I INQUIRED WITH LANDSTAR AND FOUND THAT NOTICES WERE BEING SENT TO A VOIDED MAILBOX.  WILL MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO PAY AMOUNT OWED AND HAVE THEM CLEARED OFF MY CREDIT REPORT BY 04/2002.""
