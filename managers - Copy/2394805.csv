  ""Firm Name"" : ""RBC Capital Markets, LLC"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Permitted to Resign"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Related to the Firms private securities transaction policy"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I introduced two friends, one, the former CEO of Chipotle, and the other, the former Director of Research of Janus to a small company looking for investors.  I did this on company e-mail and even spoke to RBC bankers about this.  I did not realize this required pre-approval from RBC Compliance. When the company offered a finder's fee, I filed a OBA with RBC (after the fact) and was permitted to resign.""
