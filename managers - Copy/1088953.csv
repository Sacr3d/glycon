  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I DISAGREE WITH THE CLIENT'S ALLEGATION DIRECTED AT ME REGARDING \""FAILURE TO SUPERVISE\"" AND OBJECT TO BEING NAMED IN THIS MATTER. THIS ALLEGATION IS FALSE AND HAS NO MERIT OR TRUTH TO IT.  AS THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR HANDLES THE DAY TO DAY ORDERS WITH THE CLIENT, I WOULD HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ORDERS THAT WERE NOT ENTERED TO THE CLIENT'S SATISFACTION UNLESS THE CLIENT RAISED AN ISSUE SPECIFICALLY. I HAVE MET THE CLIENT FACE TO FACE ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS AND DOCUMENTED MY DISCUSSION WITH HIM IN 2008 IN OUR SUPERVISORY REVIEW SYSTEM. AT NO TIME DID THE CLIENT RAISE ANY ISSUE WITH THE TRADING ACTIVITY IN HIS ACCOUNT AND IN FACT HE INDICATED THAT HE WAS VERY HAPPY WORKING WITH THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR AND THAT THE TRADING IS MOSTLY \""UNSOLICITED.\"" THE CLIENT KNEW MY NAME AND COULD HAVE RAISED ANY ISSUE WITH ME IF HE FELT THAT AN ORDER WAS NOT ENTERED CORRECTLY BUT HE DID NOT NOTIFY US OF ANY ISSUES UNTIL THIS STATEMENT OF CLAIM WAS RECEIVED SEEKING DAMAGES.""
