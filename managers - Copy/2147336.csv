  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Sparks consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that she willfully failed to update her Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer (Form U4) to disclose a bankruptcy petition within 30 days of filing the petition. The findings stated that when questioned by her member firm, Sparks claimed she previously disclosed the 2013 bankruptcy in an email to her firm's compliance. The firm searched its email system to find any such email sent by or received from Sparks and no email could be found. Following an interview with Sparks the firm terminated her for violating company policies pertaining to honesty and keeping current on required Form U4 disclosures. The findings also stated that during an on-the-record interview (OTR) with FINRA, Sparks provided a purported copy of the alleged email to her firm compliance and testified under oath that, among other things, she sent the disclosure email to her firm's compliance. The document provided by Sparks to FINRA was a fabricated document, and Sparks' testimony pertaining to her alleged disclosure of the bankruptcy was false and misleading."",
