  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I OFFERED MY RESIGNATION AFTER LEARNING THAT I MAY HAVE VIOLATED A COMPANY POLICY DUE TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENT THAT HAD BEEN INITIALED BY ME.

NO FIANCIAL AGAIN OR LOSS WAS INCURRED BY THE CUSTOMER, NOR DID IT RESULT IN ANY MATERIAL CHANGE TO THE CONTRACT.  IN MY PROSPECTIVE IT WAS AN ADMINITRATIVE ERROR WHICH IS WHY I WAS PERMITTED TO RESIGN FROM THE FIRM.""
