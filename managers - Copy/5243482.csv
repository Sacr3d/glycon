  ""Firm Name"" : ""LPL FINANCIAL LLC"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Recommendations that appear inconsistent with customer profiles."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In an attempt to generate more income and provide an opportunity for growth, a well-rated high yield closed-end bond fund was recommended to some clients for no more than 5% to 10% of their portfolio.  After approving the trades the compliance officer stated this investment appeared to be inconsistent with the customer profile of a few clients over the age of 75.  These clients were contacted and the fund was sold from their portfolio without a loss.  No client complaints were received, yet the firm terminated the advisor.""
