  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Complaint came from an high net worth client who is very sophisticated about business, investments and markets.  The strategy was discussed several times over a period of months and the client was made fully aware of the strategy's potential for volatility and the types of market environments that could lead to greater downside volatility.   After his review, the client made the decision he understood and liked the strategy and chose to participate at a level that represented a very small portion of his net worth.  The client was also kept fully abreast of developments as more challenging market environments manifested and was given multiple opportunities and suggestions for exiting the strategy if it no longer was comfortable.  Detailed notes of all conversations were kept all throughout the process and entire relationship.  The client did not name me as a party to the arbitration.  I am comfortable that I handled the customer account properly and acted in the best interests of the client at all times.""
