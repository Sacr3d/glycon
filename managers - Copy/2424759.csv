  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Representative Statement: This is a case of abuse of power by an off-duty Park Ranger.  On May 26, 2010 I was travelling in the freeway fast lane at the speed limit. A pickup came behind me flashing his lights and motioning for me to move over.  As he pulled around me on the right the driver appeared very angry and flashed a badge at me. He motioned for me to pull over.  Not knowing this guy I certainly was not going to pull over.  A short time later the California Highway Patrol appeared and pulled me over.  The pickup behind me was driven by an off-duty Park Ranger and he pulled in behind the CHP.  The Park Ranger was very angry because would not pull over and demanded the CHP officer arrest me saying that I had exposed myself to him.  The CHP officer refused.  The Park Ranger was really angry now and told the CHP officer he was making a citizen's arrest.  The CHP officer had no choice but to arrest me.  The Park Ranger swore out a complaint mistakenly using a felony complaint that was reserved for those with a prior conviction.  This was absolutely incorrect since I had never been arrested for anything, much less a charge like this.   Within days the Felony charge was reduced to a misdemeanor because I had no prior record.  When my attorney went to court for the first time, he was told all the charges against me had been dismissed.    I believe the park ranger fabricated the charges against me because he was so mad that I did not pull over when he flashed his badge.  I believe he fabricated false charges against me to try to punish me.""
