  ""Regulator Statement"" : ""Hearing panel decision rendered April 7, 2017. The sanctions were based on findings that White borrowed $10,000 from a 69-year-old customer, knowing she was not permitted to borrow money from a customer.  The findings stated that White received a $10,000 cashier's check from the customer and paid the customer the $10,000 (plus a $600 profit) back over the following six months. When White's member firm found out about the loan and confronted her, White took the position that the $10,000 was not a loan, but the purchase price for the sale of her tractor to the customer, and she paid $10,600 to buy the tractor back from the customer. The decision became final May 25, 2017. As of March 26, 2018, White has not paid the fines/costs associated with this case.""
