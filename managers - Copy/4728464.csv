  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE REASON FOR THE PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY WAS DUE TO A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN INCOME DUE TO A COMPANY CHANGE.  ADVANCED EQUITIES INC. WAS THE FIRM I WAS EMPLOYED AND AND TIED DOWN WITH A CONTRACT.  THE FIRM LOST IT'S CAPABILITY TO HOLD MANAGED ACCOUNTS AND ULTIMATELY MY EXISTING CLIENTS WERE UNABLE TO MOVE THEIR ASSETS OVER.

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I AM WRITING IN RESPONSE TO PRUCO SECURITIES, LLC. ALLEGATIONS OF VIOLATING INVESTMENT-RELATED STATUES, REGULATIONS, RULES OR INDUSTRY STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND FRAUD OR THE WRONGFUL TAKING OF PROPERTY AS DOCUMENTED IN MY U-5 UNDER 7F.  PRUCO SECURITIES, LLC ALLEGES THAT I SIGNED A CLIENT'S NAME, TO A COMPANY FOR AND DID NOT COMPLY WITH \""COMPANY\"" REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS.  I HOLD THIS NOT TO BE TRUE.  THE CLIENT WAS MY GRANDMOTHER WITH WHICH I DID NOT SIGN ON OF THE MULTIPLE FORMS TO OPEN A VARIABLE ANNUITY.  THE TIME LINE OF THE SALES PROCESS STARTED IN FEBRUARY OF 2004 AND THE VARIABLE ANNUITIES WERE OPENED IN APRIL 2004.  AT THIS POINT SHE HAD BECOME VERY LEERY OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS BECAUSE MY APPOINTED MANAGER AND MYSELF HAD GONE BACK TO HER ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT OCCASIONS ALREADY.  MY MANAGER AT THE TIME, [MANAGER], INSTRUCTED ME TO CALL MY GRANDMOTHER AND ASK FOR HER PERMISSION TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT ON HER BEHALF.  SHE GLADLY GAVE ME THE AUTHORIZATION OVER THE PHONE WITH [MANAGER] CONFERENCE IN.  I SUBMITTED THE PAPERWORK TO THE SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT.  THE OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT CAME BACK AND ASKED IF I SIGNED THE PAPER AND I SAID \""YES I DID.\""  AT THAT TIME THEY ASKED FOR A LIMITED POWER OF ATTORNEY DOCUMENT.  I DID NOT HAVE ONE AND GAVE THEM THE STORY.  [MANAGER] PUT IN HIS RESIGNATION, AND I WAS LEFT WITHOUT A MANAGER FOR THE NEXT SEVEN MONTHS WHEN PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL DECIDED TO TERMINATE ME FOR BEING SICK AND OUT OF WORK.  PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL STILL FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH THE CONTRACTS, AND THE VARIABLE ANNUITIES ARE STILL IN FORCE EVEN THOUGH MY GRANDMOTHER NEVER SIGNED THE DOCUMENTS.""
