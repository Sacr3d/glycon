  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS APPROACHED BY AN OFFICER IN UNIFORM AND ASKED IF I WOULD KEEP IT DOWN.  I AGREED.  THE OFFICER CONTINUED TO STARE ME DOWN.  I THEN APPROACHED HIM AND ASKED IF I HAD DONE SOMETHING WRONG.  HE BECAME AGITATED & FORCED MY ARM AROUND MY BACK & UP TOWARD MY HEAD.  I RESISTED BECAUSE I FELT MY ARM WAS GOING TO BREAK.  HE HANDCUFFED ME AND PLACED ME IN THE PATROL CAR.  AT THIS POINT I WAS TOTALLY CONFUSED AS TO WHY I WAS BEING ARRESTED FOR SIMPLY ASKING A QUESTION.  THE OFFICER TOOK MY WALLET AND REMOVED MY BROTHERS ID AND ASSUMED IT WAS MINE.  I WAS AFRAID TO SAY OTHERWISE AT THAT POINT.  MY LEGAL COUNSEL DEALT W/ALL THE SITUATIONS AND INFORMED ME THAT I WOULD PLEA TO A LESSER CHARGE OF RESISTING ARREST W/OUT VIOLENCE. CONCERNING THE IMPERSONATING CHARGE, I HAVE NO IDEA WHY I WAS CHARGED WITH THAT BECAUSE IT DIDN`T HAPPEN.  THE PROSECUTOR & MY ATTORNEY AGREED TO DISMISS THE CHARGE.  MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THE COURTS W/HELD ADJUDICATION & HAD NO OBJECTIONS TO THE RECORDS BEING SEALED.  I ASSUMED THEY WERE.  THAT IS WHY I DID NOT DISCLOSE THE CHARGES ON MY APPLICATION.  WHEN I LATER FOUND OUT THEY WEREN`T SEALED I AM TAKING THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO SEAL THEM.""
