  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Rep was not aware of this lien that we are disclosing now. The current state of this lien is as follows. He has currently hired a tax attorney to represent him with this lien. He found out through a new CPA that his past 1040 Personal income Tax returns dating back to 2006 had been filed incorrectly. It appears that his income was actually counted twice from both my DBA organization, then counted again on his personal 1040 returns indicating an income much larger than he actually made. He never understood what the issue was until he hired a new CPA, and tax attorney. For all those years he could not figure out what went wrong and why his tax bill was so high based on the actual income he made and where the liens were coming from. This lien in discussion is for tax year 2014. His CPA will re-file his 2014 1040 tax return next week will show my true income for tax year 2014 and this should either eliminate this lien, or reduce it to a manageable amount that he will be able to pay off the balance shortly after. Once this is completed and refiled next week, his CPA will then try to go back as far as the IRS allows to re-file and re-state my income through re-filed 1040 Tax returns to reflect my true income and hopefully release as many of the filed IRS liens as possible. He is currently working diligently with his advisers to fix and rid this problem once and for all as soon as possible.""
