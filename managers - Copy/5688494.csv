  ""Broker Comment"" : ""AT A FRATERNITY HOUSE PARTY I NOTICED A PHOTO LEANING AGAINST A WALL.  I HELD IT UP FOR SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS TO SEE.  A MEMBER OF A RIVAL FRATERNITY SAW ME HOLDING PROPERTY THAT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE FRATERNITY HOUSE, AND IMPLICATED ME AS BEING INVOLVED IN THE BREAKING AND ENTERING.  AFTER INTERVIEWING WITH THE POLICE, ALL CHARGES WERE DROPPED.  I JUST HAPPENED TO BE AT THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME.""
