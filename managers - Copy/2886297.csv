  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Charlton-Gomes consented to the sanction and to the entry of findings that in connection with the registration one of the member firm's employees with the National Futures Association (NFA), Charlton-Gomes fabricated an email ostensibly stating that the NFA had received the employee's examination information and confirming the employee's registration with the NFA. The findings stated that the firm discovered that one of its employees was not registered with the NFA. At that time, Charlton-Gomes' responsibilities included submitting registration-related documents on behalf of the firm. The findings also stated that during this time, Charlton-Gomes maintained that she had submitted the requisite information to the NFA concerning the employee's registration. In support, Charlton-Gomes fabricated an email that she purportedly received from an NFA employee, which confirmed that the NFA had received the employee's examination results and the registration had been approved. The findings also included that Charlton-Gomes then provided this fabricated email to both the firm and the NFA as evidence that the employee should have been properly registered. Not only did the email prove to be falsified, but the purported sender of the email had never been employed by NFA."",
