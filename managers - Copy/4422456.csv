  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ORIGINALLY CHARGED WITH FORGERY AND FRAUD USE CREDIT CARD.  THEY WERE DOWNGRADED TO THEFT BY DECEPTION AND WRONGUL IMPERSONATION. ON 3/15/99 I WAS WORKING FOR THE RETAIL STORE OLD NAVY.  WHILE WORKING, I WAITED ON A CUSTOMER WHO LATER CLAIMED THAT I HAD STOLEN HER CREDIT CARD.  AS PER THE POLICE REPORTS, THE CARD WAS USED ON THAT DAY AT 2 OTHER RETAIL STORES IN THE HAMILTON TOWNSHIP MALL.  APPROXIMATELY 1 WEEK LATER, I WAS INFORMED BY THE STORE MANAGER AT OLD NAVY THAT I WAS BEING INVESTIGATED FOR THE CRIME.  I THEN WILLINGLY WENT TO THE HAMILTON TWP. MUNICIPAL COURT HOUSE TO SPEAK WITH THE DETECTIVE HANDLING THIS CASE.  HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THE CRIME AND THAT ONE OF THE STORE CLERKS WHERE THE CARD HAD BEEN USED IDENTIFIED ME AS THE USER OF THE CARD.  HEN THEN BROUGHT IN ANOTHER DETECTIVE WHO BEGAN ASKING ME A LOT OF QUESTIONS.  THEY THEN PROCEEDED TO GIVE ME MY OPTION.  I WAS TOLD THAT IF I ADMITTED THE CHARGES, THEY WOULD ISSUE ME A SUMMONS AND ALLOW ME TO GO HOME.  I WOULD NOT DO ANY JAIL TIME AND THEY WOULD NOT INFORM MY COLLEGE.  OR IF I DID NOT ADMIT TO IT, I WOULD BE ARRESTED, HAVE TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN JAIL AND GO THROUGH A TRIAL AND MY SCHOOL WOULD BE NOTIFIED.  OUT OF FEAR AND STUPIDITY I ADMITTED THE CHARGES AND SIGNED A CONFESSION.  ONCE HOME, I CONTACTED MY PARENTS WHO THEN CONTACTED MY ATTORNEY.  AFTER MEETING WITH HIM AND REVIEWING THE CHARGES, WE WENT TO COURT ON 6/29/99, AND HE INFORMED ME THAT THE SIGNED CONFESSION WOULD BE TOUGH TO FIGHT.  HE ADVISED ME TO PLEAD GUILTY TO THE LESSER CHARGE OF THEFT BY DECEPTION AND WRONGFUL IMPERSONATION, WHICH ARE MISDEMEANORS.  I DID SO AND THE JUDGE ISSUED ME A FINE, WHICH I PAID THAT DAY AND I LEFT THE COURTHOUSE.""
