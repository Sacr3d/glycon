  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Admin Release 34-50507; IA Release 40-2312; Investment Company Release 40-26630, October 8, 2004: The SEC deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 against Raymond R. Cunningham. In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer of Settlement, which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission's jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. On the basis of this Order and Respondent's Offer, the Commission finds that this is a proceeding against Raymond R. Cunningham, the former CEO, president, and COO of a registered investment adviser (the \""Firm\"") to a mutual fund (the \""Funds\""), based on his involvement in the Firm's market timing program from 2001 through July 2003. By entering into market timing agreements, the Firm breached its fiduciary duties to the Funds. The agreements also contravened the Funds' prospectus disclosures. Under the market timing agreements, the Firm, through Cunningham permitted certain select investors (\""Market Timers\"") to make excessive exchanges and redemptions totaling approximately $58 billion in select Funds. The Firm required, either expressly or tacitly, the Market Timers' investment of \""sticky assets\"" in the Funds (i.e., long-term money that would remain in a particular fund without being actively traded) under some of the agreements. The market timing agreements financially benefited the Firm in that it realized additional advisory fees from the timed Funds and sticky assets under its management. Because the Firm had reason to believe that the assets brought to the Funds under the market timing agreements, while serving to increase its advisory fees, could be traded in a manner detrimental to the Funds, it had a conflict of interest with the Funds. The Firm and Cunningham failed to disclose the conflict of interest to the board of directors of the Funds or to the Fund shareholders and obtain the board members' consent to the agreements, thereby breaching its fiduciary duty to the Funds. The market timing agreements were also inconsistent with the disclosures made in the Funds' prospectuses. The prospectuses stated that shareholders could make up to four exchanges out of each Fund per twelve-month period. The market timing agreements provided for more than the disclosed number of exchanges. Furthermore, while the prospectuses also disclosed that each Fund reserved the right to modify the exchange policy if such a modification was determined to be in the best interests of the Fund, the Firm failed to make an appropriate determination that each proposed market timing agreement was in the best interest of the Fund before entering into the agreement. In the aggregate, the market timing trades made under the agreements were detrimental to the Funds' shareholders. As a result of this conduct, Cunningham willfully aided and abetted and caused the Firm's violations of Section 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act, and willfully violated Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act."",
