  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MATTER CASE WAS AMICABLY RESOLVED BETWEEN THE PARTIES PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF AN ARBITRATION HEARING. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF SETTLEMENT, CLAIMANT WAS PAID A LUMP SUM OF $30,000.00. ALL ALLEGATIONS MADE WERE DENIED. AMONG OTHER CORROBATIVE DEFENSE SET FORTH IN THE ANSWER WAS THE \""FACT\"" THAT [CUSTOMER] WAS A SOPHISTICATED INVESTOR WITH A LONG HISTORY OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INVESTING PRIOR TO MEETING MR. JASPER. HOWEVER, THE BROKER-DEALER NAMED AS A RESPONDENT (DEFENDANT) HAD DISSOLVED TWO (2) YEARS PRIOR TO THE CASE FILING, LEAVING MR. JASPER TO DEFEND THE CLAIM ALONE. GIVEN THE COSTS (IN EXCESS OF SETTLEMENT) AND TIME COMMITMENT (I.E. LOST EARNINGS) ASSOCIATED WITH DEFENDING A PROTRACTED ARBITRATION CASE IN FLORIDA, MR. JASPER, WHILE MAINTAINING HIS INNOCENCE AND THE INCREDULITY OF [CUSTOMER'S] ALLEGATIONS, DECIDED THAT IT WAS BEST TO RESOLVE THE MATTER PRIOR TO THE ARBITRATION HEARING.""
