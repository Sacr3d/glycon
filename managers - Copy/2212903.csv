  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE IR INDICATED THAT DURING HIS INITIAL MEETING WITH THE CLIENT, SHE WAS VERY CONCERNED  ABOUT THE DECLINE IN VALUE OF HER EQUITY MUTUAL FUNDS. MR. QUINN SUGGESTED THAT SHE  MAY WANT TO SELL HER STOCK MUTUAL FUNDS, AND BUY INDIVIDUAL BONDS FOR INCOME. SINCE  THE CLIENT WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THESE BONDS, SHE ONLY WANTED  INSURED BONDS. THEREFORE, MR. QUINN SUGGESTED ONLY INSURED TAX FREE BONDS. THE IR  PROVIDED THE CLIENT WITH A BROCHURE ON \""HOW BONDS WORK\"", DURING THEIR INITIAL VISIT.  ALTHOUGH THE BOND VALUES HAVE DECLINED, THE CLIENT IS STILL EARNING THE STATED RATE  OF INTEREST ON THE FULL FACE AMOUNT. IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING, THAT THE IR PROPERLY  DISCLOSED THE FEATURES OF THESE BONDS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THE CLIENT'S CLAIM  WAS DENIED.""
