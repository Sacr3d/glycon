I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS INCIDENT AS BEING ARRESTED, SO I ACCIDENTALLY DIDN`T DISCLOSE THIS EVENT. THE N.J. SECURITIES COMMISSIONER PICKED THIS UP WHEN I APPLIED FOR SERIES 7 IN 1972 & CALLED ME IN FOR A HEARING AT WHICH TIME THE COMMISSIONER HEARD THE FACTS & ISSUED A 5 DAY SUSPENSION. NO FURTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN AFTER 5 DAY SUSPENSION HAPPENED IN 1973.""
