  ""Allegations"" : ""WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, SMITH CONSENTED TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT HIS MEMBER FIRM CUSTOMER INFORMED HIM THAT THE CUSTOMER AND HIS WIFE INTENDED TO MOVE THEIR IRA ACCOUNTS, WHICH WERE HELD AT ANOTHER INVESTMENT COMPANY, TO A DIFFERENT FINANCIAL ADVISOR. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT DURING THE MEETING, SMITH BECAME UPSET AND THREATENED TO LIQUIDATE THE CUSTOMER AND HIS WIFE'S IRA ACCOUNTS AND HAVE THE PROCEEDS SENT TO THEM IN AN EFFORT TO CAUSE ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MEETING, THE CUSTOMER CONTACTED THE INVESTMENT COMPANY AND INSTRUCTED THEM TO PROHIBIT SMITH FROM MAKING ANY CHANGES TO HIS AND HIS WIFE'S IRA ACCOUNTS. THE FOLLOWING DAY, SMITH CONTACTED THE INVESTMENT COMPANY AND, WITHOUT THE CUSTOMER AND HIS WIFE'S KNOWLEDGE, AUTHORIZATION OR CONSENT, INSTRUCTED IT TO LIQUIDATE THEIR IRA ACCOUNTS. HOWEVER, SMITH'S LIQUIDATION REQUEST WAS DENIED BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE IRA ACCOUNTS."",
