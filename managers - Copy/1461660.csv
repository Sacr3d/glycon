  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC Admin Release 34-88732; IA Release 5486, April 23, 2020: The Securities and Exchange Commission (\""Commission\"") deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\""Exchange Act\"") and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\""Advisers Act\"") against Stephen Douglas Pizzuti. On November 5, 2019, Pizzuti pled guilty to one count of concealment of assets in a bankruptcy case, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 152(1), before the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, in United States v. Stephen Douglas Pizzuti, Case No. 6:19-cr-00204. On January 13, 2020, Pizzuti was sentenced to two years probation. The Court also ordered forfeiture and restitution, both in the amount of $28,002.40. In connection with that plea, Pizzuti admitted that on October 23, 2015, he and his wife filed a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition that failed to identify as an asset Pizzuti's book of business from his time as a broker. On November 1, 2015, Pizzuti sold his book of business for $300,000 consisting of an immediate partial payment, with the balance due over time. On November 24, 2015, at a Section 341 creditor's meeting, Pizzuti, under oath, falsely represented that he had not transferred or sold any assets beyond what was disclosed in the bankruptcy petition. Over the course of a year, Pizzuti received over $28,000 from the buyer of the book of business, which Pizzuti concealed by receiving the funds in cash or in the form of wire transfers to his wife and son."",
