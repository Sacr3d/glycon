  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The representative denies the allegations that the client was not informed of the taxes he would incur on the annuity surrender. The client worked directly with American National to surrender the annuity and elected to not withhold taxes. In addition, the representative feels he provided options to the client for reinvestment of the funds and that the client did not agree with those options. The respondents are jointly and severally liable for and shall pay to the claimant the sum of $11,043.00 in compensatory damages and interest at the rate of 6% per annum from April 1, 2016 through and including the date of the award.""
