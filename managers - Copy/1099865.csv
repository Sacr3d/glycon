  ""Allegations"" : ""Client alleges that Mr. Conway and Summit did not perform adequate vetting of an outside investment opportunity brought to Conway by the Client. Neither Conway nor Summit recommended, managed, monitored, or received payment on the investment opportunity. Client unilaterally made the decision to invest in 2007 and 2009. The investment turned out to be a product of fraud, and its promoter was ultimately convicted."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Conway and Summit settled this matter for nuisance value, and not based on any admission of liability.  The claims were baseless and without merit. Client acknowledged that he  individually and without the assistance of Conway or Summit identified the opportunity and invested upon his own accord, not through Summit and not upon the recommendation of Summit or Conway. Ultimately, the investment turned out to be a fraud. Conway had tried to dissuade the Client from investing in the opportunity to no avail, and informed him of a \""high-degree of risk and potential for a total loss.\"" Despite Conway's position, the Client made a total investment of one million dollars in the fraudulent opportunity in 2007 and 2009, acknowledging that he was proceeding with the investment on his own. Client continued his relationship with Summit and Conway for several years even after it was apparent to Client that the promoter of the investment had committed fraud""
