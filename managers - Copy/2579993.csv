  ""Broker Comment"" : ""FA HAS BEEN WORKING WITH CLIENT 2004.  FA HAS INDICATED CLIENT HELD A DIVERSIFIED ACCT UNTIL HER OUTLOOK CHANGED IN MID 9/08. FA STATED HE MET WITH CLIENT FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS REVIEWING EACH OF HER INVESTMENTS IN GREAT DETAIL.  IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING ON 9/17/08 CLIENT SPOKE WITH FA AND INSTRUCTED HIM TO LIQUIDATE HER ENTIRE PORTFOLIO.  FA ADVISED AGAINST SELLING BASED ON EMOTIONS; HOWEVER, THE PORTFOLIO WAS LIQUIDATED.  FA INDICATED HE MET WITH CLIENT THE FOLLOWING DAY TO DISCUSS REINVESTMENT OPTIONS, INCLUDING CDS, CORP BONDS, MUNI BONDS, FIXED ANNUITIES AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  FA STATED CLIENT INFORMED HIM SHE HAD INVESTED IN MUNICIPAL BONDS IN THE PAST AND THE DETAILS OF THE WEST VIRGINIA HOSPITAL BOND WERE REVIEWED.  FA FURTHER STATED CLIENT ATTENDED WVU AND SHE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE HOSPITALS ISSUING THE BOND.  IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING FA SUGGESTED INVESTING $50,000.00 IN THIS BOND; HOWEVER, CLIENT MADE THE DECISION TO PURCHASE $100,000.00.  SINCE THIS PURCHASE REPRESENTED 15% OF THE CLIENT'S STATED NET WORTH, CLIENT SIGNED A BUY ACKNOWLEDGMENT LETTER CONFIRMING HER UNDERSTANDING OF THE BOND FEATURES AND RISKS, INCLUDING MARKET FLUCTUATION.  FA MET WITH CLIENT ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS (IN SEPT AND OCT 2008) TO MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING THE REINVESTMENT OF THE SALE PROCEEDS.  FA HAS STATED IT WAS NOT UNTIL 10/27/08 THAT CLIENT EXPRESSED CONCERN REGARDING THE WV BOND PURCHASED.  FA INDICATED CLIENT HAD READ AN ARTICLE IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER RELATING TO THE DECLINE IN VALUE OF WV'S INVESTMENTS AND CLIENT NO LONGER HAD FAITH IN THE STATE OF WV.  WHILE WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND CLIENT'S DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE DECLINE IN VALUE OF THE BOND, MARKET FLUCTUATION IS A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OWNING ANY INVESTMENT.  BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THIS MATTER, IT APPEARS THE FA EXPLAINED THE DETAILS OF THE WV HOSPITAL BOND AND CLIENT AUTHORIZED THE TRANSACTION.""
