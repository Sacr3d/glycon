  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I BEGAN CONSULTING WITH THE CLIENT'S WHO ARE AN ELDERLY MARRIED COUPLE.  OVER OUR RELATIONSHIP, WHICH INCLUDED MANY CONVERSATIONS AND FACE TO FACE APPOINTMENTS WITH THE CLIENTS AS WELL AS THEIR  DAUGHTER, THE MAIN FOCUS FOR INVESTING PURPOSES WAS TO GENERATE AS MUCH INCOME AS POSSIBLE TO ALLOW THEM TO SUSTAIN THEIR LIVING EXPENSES.  BASED ON THE SOURCES OF FUNDS AND THE INCOME AMOUNTS NEEDED, A HIGH INCOME APPROACH WAS TAKEN AND AGREED UPON BY ALL PARTIES, EVEN THOUGH RISKIER TO THE PRINCIPAL, HOWEVER NECESSARY TO GENERATE INCOME TO LIVE ON FROM THE INTEREST.  THOROUGH DISCUSSIONS WERE HELD REGARDING THE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF A MORE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH (CDS AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS) VERSUS A MORE AGGRESSIVE PORTFOLIO (BOND FUNDS INCLUDING THOSE IN HIGH INCOME).  ANALYTICS (THE SCIENCE OF ANALYSIS), WHICH SHOWED HOW MUCH WAS NEEDED EACH YEAR IN INCOME AND HOW MUCH INCOME FROM EACH STRATEGY WOULD BE GENERATED, WAS USED TO MAKE THE DECISION.  AT THE TIME, THE INCOME NEEDED WOULD FORCE THE MORE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO USE A GOOD DEAL OF PRINCIPAL EACH YEAR TO SUPPLEMENT THE LACK OF INCOME PROVIDED.  THERE WAS NOT A SPECIFIC APPROACH THAT WAS THRUST UPON THEM.  THE CLIENT'S MADE A DECISION THAT THE HIGHER INCOME STRATEGY WAS BEST FOR THEIR SITUATION AND WERE WILLING TO ACCEPT A HIGHER DEGREE OF RISK TO THEIR PRINCIPAL.  OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, HOUSES WERE BOUGHT AND SOLD, THE CLIENT'S MOVED INTO AN ASSISTED LIVING APARTMENT, ONE OF THE CLIENT'S PASSED ( THE HUSBAND) AND THE OTHER CLIENT (WIFE) CONTINUED TO DRIVE IN TO DO HER BANKING AND SEE ME.  I CONTINUED TO WORK WITH HER AND SPOKE MANY TIMES TO HER DAUGHTER ABOUT THE CONDITION OF HER MOTHERS ACCOUNT.  DURING MY FINAL YEAR AT MORGAN KEEGAN, PRIOR TO COMING TO UBS, THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 07/08 WAS TAKING PLACE AND DEVALUING ALL ASSETS IN THE HIGHER INCOME SPACES.  I WAS VERY DILIGENT IN TRYING TO HELP MY CLIENTS MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS WITH PARTICULAR REGARD TO THE MORGAN KEEGAN INCOME FUNDS MANAGED BY JIM KELSOE.  I TOOK PART IN AND TOOK NOTES FROM CONFERENCE CALLS WITH OUR FIXED INCOME DEPARTMENT--INCLUDING THOSE WITH JIM KELSOE SPECIFICALLY.  I ATTENDED MEETINGS IN NASHVILLE AND MEMPHIS (HOME OFFICE) WHERE THE TOPIC, HOW SHOULD WE ADVISE OUR CLIENTS BASED ON WHAT IS HAPPENING, WAS DISCUSSED BY OUR HEADS OF FIXED INCOME AND EVEN ADDRESSED BY OUR PRESIDENT.  I WOULD CALL MY CLIENTS, INCLUDING THE CLIENT'S DAUGHTER AND EXPLAIN WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE MARKETS, WITH THE INCOME FUNDS AND WHAT OUR OPTIONS WERE.  THIS COMPLAINT SEEMS TO BE COMING OUT OF LEFT FIELD DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE DAUGHTER WAS WELL INFORMED, THROUGH MY DEPARTURE (SEPT 2008), AS TO WHAT THE STATE OF THE FUNDS WERE: VALUE, YIELD AND OPTIONS (TO HOLD THEM OR SELL THEM AT A LOSS AND LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR INCOME).  THE DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS COMPLIMENTARY OF THE WAY I HAD WORKED WITH AND HANDLED HER PARENTS ACCOUNTS AND WOULD MAKE IT A POINT WHEN SHE WAS IN TOWN TO COME BY AND SEE ME TO REVIEW AND SAY THANKS.  I CAN ONLY DEFEND MY ACTIONS AND MY PHILOSOPHY IN HELPING THE CLIENT'S TO PROVIDE THE INCOME NEEDED AS THEIR EXPENSES ROSE DRAMATICALLY FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES AND CARE.  I CANNOT DEFEND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE MORGAN KEEGAN INCOME FUNDS.  I MYSELF PERSONALLY LOST SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS DUE TO THEIR MANAGEMENT AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008.  I WAS DISHEARTENED GREATLY BY THE LOSSES THAT WERE RELATED TO THE MK INCOME FUNDS THAT MANY OF MY CLIENTS DEALT WITH.  I DO FEEL THAT I GAVE MY VERY BEST EFFORT IN GATHERING INFORMATION ABOUT THE KELSOE FUNDS, LISTENING TO COMMENTS AND Q AND A'S FROM OUR FIXED INCOME TEAM, AND DISCUSSING OPTIONS WITH MY CLIENTS.  I AM LIKEWISE DISHEARTED IN THIS SITUATION THAT RESTITUTION IS BEING SOUGHT WHEN THE DECISIONS WERE MADE AND AGREED UPON BY THE DAUGHTER, SHE WAS INFORMED DURING THE DOWNTURN WHAT OPTIONS THERE WERE FOR HER PARENTS ACCOUNT AND SHE WAS CONTENT THEN WITH THE INCOME COMING IN AND THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION THAT I WAS RELAYING TO HER WITH REGARD TO THE MK INCOME FUNDS.""
