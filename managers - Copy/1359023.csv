A WRITTEN STATEMENT BY DEAN WITTER STATES THAT THE CLAIM LACKED MERIT BECAUSE THE TYPE OF INVESTING THAT THE CLIENT WAS ENGAGED IN WAS NOT RECOMMENDED BY ME, NOR SOLICITED BY ME, AND THAT I TRIED TO DISCOURAGE IT. ACCORDING TO DEAN WITTER, THE SETTLEMENT WAS REACHED IN THE INTEREST OF PRESERVING GOOD WILL AND TO CLEAR A LONG PENDING MATTER.""
