  ""Broker Comment"" : ""BOTH MY SPOUSE AND I LOST OUR JOBS DURING THE RECESSION. WITH 3 BOYS UNDER 5 YEARS OLD, WE HAD TO ACCRUE DEBT TO SURVIVE UNTIL WE COULD GET BACK ON OUR FEET.  OUR CHOICE TO FILE BANKRUPTCY WAS NOT TAKEN LIGHTLY. PREVIOUSLY, WE'D BOTH HAD GREAT CREDIT AND WERE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. LIKE MANY OTHERS DURING THAT PERIOD, WE WERE VICTIMS OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND DID THE BEST WE COULD TO KEEP OUR FAMILY ABOVE WATER. THE BANKRUPTCY WAS DISCHARGED ALMOST A YEAR AGO AND IS IN THE PAST. WE ARE NOW FINANCIALLY STABLE AND WORKING HARD TO REBUILD OUR FINANCES.""
