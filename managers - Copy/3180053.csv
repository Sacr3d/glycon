THE [CUSTOMERS] STATE THAT THIS WAS BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION BY [OTHER FIRM EMPLOYEE], AN AGENT WITH METLIFE IN MADISON, WI.   (JULY 15, 2011 9:08 A.M.) AFTER FINDING OUT ABOUT THE FILED COMPLAINT MADE BY THE [CUSTOMER] I CALLED THE MANAGING PARTNER AT METLIFE SECURITIES IN MADISON, WI. [SUPERVISOR], MY FORMER SUPERVISOR STATED HE DID NOT REMEMBER ANY COMPLAINTS FILED AGAINST ME.
