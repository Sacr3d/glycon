  ""Allegations"" : ""NASD RULE 2110 AND 3010(B): BETWEEN 2006 AND 2007, PUPLAVA PERMITTED HIS NON-REGISTERED ASSISTANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO HIS SIGNATURE GUARANTEE STAMP AND FAILED TO SUPERVISE HER TO PREVENT ITS MISUSE. THE NON-REGISTERED ASSISTANT, WITHOUT PUPLAVA'S KNOWLEDGE, PERMITTED THE FIRM'S REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES TO USE PUPLAVA'S SIGNATURE GUARANTEE STAMP TO APPROVE SECURITIES BUSINESS-RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND PAPERWORK THAT REQUIRED A SIGNATURE GUARANTEE STAMP.  PUPLAVA DISCOVERED THIS PRACTICE AND INSTRUCTED HIS NON-REGISTERED ASSISTANT AND THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES INVOLVED TO DISCONTINUE THE USE OF HIS SIGNATURE GUARANTEE STAMP. HOWEVER, PUPLAVA DID NOT TAKE BACK HIS SIGNATURE GUARANTEE STAMP OR TAKE STEPS TO OTHERWISE SECURE THE SIGNATURE GUARANTEE STAMP TO PREVENT ITS MISUSE.  THIS PRACTICE OF USING PUPLAVA'S SIGNATURE GUARANTEE STAMP WITHOUT HIS APPROVAL CONTINUED THOUGH 2007. PUPLAVA HAD CUSTOMERS SIGN BLANK SECURITIES BUSINESS-RELATED FORMS AND RETAINED THESE SIGNED BLANK SECURITIES BUSINESS-RELATED FORMS IN HIS CUSTOMER FILES.  PUPLAVA WAS AWARE OF HIS MEMBER FIRM'S PROHIBITION AGAINST THIS PRACTICE.  THE FIRM PERFORMED A COMPLIANCE EXAM AT PUPLAVA'S BRANCH OFFICE AND DISCOVERED PRE-SIGNED BLANK FORMS IN THE FILES OF CUSTOMERS BELONGING TO PUPLAVA. ALL OF THE FORMS DISCOVERED IN PUPLAVA'S CUSTOMER FILES WERE SECURITIES BUSINESS-RELATED FORMS AND INCLUDED NON-BROKERAGE CHANGE REQUEST FORMS, MUTUAL FUND TRANSFER FORMS AND SECURITIES ACCOUNT FORMS."",
