  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Sova consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he participated in private securities transactions without providing written notice to, or obtaining approval from his member firm. The findings stated that Sova solicited investors to purchase promissory notes relating to the Woodbridge Group of Companies (\""Woodbridge\""), a purported real estate investment fund. Sova sold $250,000 in Woodbridge promissory notes to three investors, one of whom was his firm's customer. Sova received $5,000 in commissions in connection with these transactions. The firm's written supervisory procedures required registered representatives to conduct any selling activity through the firm and specifically required registered representatives to obtain firm approval before engaging in private securities transactions involving the offer of promissory notes."",
