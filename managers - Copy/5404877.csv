  ""Firm Name"" : ""J.P. MORGAN CHASE BANK, NA"",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE WAS TERMINATED AFTER VIOLATING FIRM POLICY BY: (1) ACCOMPANYING A CLIENT TO AN OUTSIDE FINANCIAL; AND (2) LOANING MONEY TO A CLIENT AND ALLEGEDLY ACCESSING THEIR ACCOUNT WITHOUT A BUSINESS REASON TO DO SO."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""ADDENDUM #1 DURING A MEETING ORGANIZED AND CONDUCTED BY A CHASE STAFF-BANKER IN AN ATTEMPT TO ROLL OVER A CHECKING ACCOUNT AT AN OUTSIDE LOCAL BANK TO CHASE, MY 92 YEAR OLD CLIENT IN A WRIST-BRACE ASKED ME IF I COULD ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE OUTSIDE LOCAL BANK TO ASSIST.  I ASKED TO CALL, BUT HE FELT MORE COMFORTABLE IN-PERSON.  THIS WAS ALL WITNESSED BY THE CHASE BANKER.  OUT OF GOOD SERVICE I GAVE HIM A RIDE AND INTRODUCED HIM TO THE OTHER BANK'S BANKER WHOM ASSISTED HIM IN GETTING A CASHIER'S CHECK THAT WAS BROUGHT IMMEDIATELY OVER TO CHASE.  THIS WAS AN ACCIDENTAL VIOLATION OF A CHASE POLICY AND I SELF-REPORTED IT TO CHASE MANAGEMENT THE VERY SAME DAY.  ABSOLUTELY ZERO IMPROPRIETY HAPPENED AND I HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY CLEARED BY FINRA'S INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION TO THE MATTER.  ADDENDUM #2 I WAS IN A PERSONAL, DATING RELATIONSHIP WITH A PERSON WHOM ALSO HAPPENED TO BE A CLIENT.  WHILE SHE WAS IN BETWEEN JOBS, I PERSONALLY LENT HER $500 FOR ABOUT ONE WEEK.  THIS TRANSACTION WAS COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM ANY BROKERAGE OR CHASE RELATED ACCOUNT OR TRANSACTION, OTHER THAN THE FACT MY GIRLFRIEND HAD A CHASE CHECKING ACCOUNT WHERE SHE BOTH DEPOSITED THE $500 TO AND PAID ME BACK FROM.  THIS TRANSACTION WAS IN COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH FINRA GUIDELINE 3240(A)2,B- THAT STATES THIS PERSON MET ALL CRITERIA FOR ME TO MAKE A PERSONAL LOAN TO.  CHASE VERIFIED THE RELATIONSHIP, AND FINRA FULLY INVESTIGATED IT AND MADE ZERO FINDINGS OF ANY VIOLATIONS.  FURTHER, REGARDING CHASE'S \""ALLEGEDLY ACCESSING THEIR ACCOUNT?\"":  THIS IS FOR THIS SAME PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP/\""CLIENT\"".  I WASN'T MADE AWARE OF THIS \""ALLEGATION\"" UNTIL ALMOST 6 MONTHS AFTER I ACCESSED THE ACCOUNT INFORMATION AS HER ADVISOR OF RECORD AND BEING PROMPTED TO DO SO.  FROM MY RECOLLECTION, I FACTUALLY KNOW IT WAS FROM ONE OF THREE REASONS, BUT HAVE NO WAY TO NEITHER SEE THE CHASE SYSTEM NOR HAVE RECORDINGS OF PHONE CALLS, CONVERSATIONS, ETC.  MY GIRLFRIEND TOLD ME HER PERSONAL E-MAIL/CELL PHONE ACCOUNT WAS HACKED DURING THE SPRING/SUMMER OF 2016, AND I MAY HAVE LOOKED FOR SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY AFTER BEING NOTIFIED.  AT ANOTHER INSTANCE SHE ASKED ME IF I COULD GET A FEE WAIVED, SO I MAY HAVE LOOKED FOR THE FEE AND DISCOVERED SHE MEANT A \""CHECKING ACCOUNT FEE\"" AS I RECALL HER BROKERAGE ACCOUNT HAD BEEN LIQUIDATED AT THAT POINT, AND LAST, HER ACCOUNT WAS STILL SHOWING UP UNDER MY MANAGEMENT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS TO HAVE BEEN MOVED TO CHASE'S CENTRALIZED SERVICING CENTER FOR <$50,000 ACCOUNTS AND I LOOKED AS TO ASCERTAIN WHY AND REVIEWED INFORMATION ACCORDINGLY.  I DO KNOW OVER THE MATTER OF ABOUT 3 MONTHS, ALL OF THESE THINGS DID OCCUR, BUT I AM UNCERTAIN TO WHAT CHASE IS SPECIFICALLY ALLEGING AND I DID NOT DO ANYTHING OUT OF THE SCOPE OF BUSINESS.  I LIKELY GOT INTERRUPTED BY A PHONE CALL, CLIENT, OR CO-WORKER AND DIDN'T NOTATE THE SYSTEM ACCORDINGLY.  SINCE I WAS ACCUSED AND FORCED TO RECOLLECT \""ON THE FLY\"" WHILE BEING INTERROGATED BY CHASE OVER THE MATTERS IN A SURPRISE, UNSCHEDULED PHONE CALL, I HAD TO TRY TO GO FROM MEMORY 6 MONTHS AND MANY TRANSACTIONS LATER.  REGARDLESS, IT WAS A ONE TIME, ISOLATED OCCURRENCE WITH ABSOLUTELY ZERO HISTORY OF EVER LOOKING AT HER OR ANYONE ELSE'S ACCOUNT WITHOUT PROPER AUTHORITY AND REASON TO DO SO IN OVER 3.25 YEARS EMPLOYED WITH CHASE.  I HAVE ZERO HISTORY OF IMPROPRIETY AND CHASE'S CHOICE OF WORDS DO NOT ACCURATELY CONVEY THE ENTIRE OCCURRENCES ACCURATELY AND UNJUSTLY LEAVE A LOT OF ROOM FOR SUSPICION OF IMPROPRIETY ON MY PART WHEN NONE HAS OCCURRED AND I HAVE BEEN FULLY INVESTIGATED WITH NO FINDINGS BY FINRA.""
