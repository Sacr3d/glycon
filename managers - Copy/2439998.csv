  ""Firm Name"" : ""U.S. BANK (U.S. BANCORP INVESTMENTS, INC. AFFILIATE)"",

  ""Allegations"" : ""TERMINATED BY BANK AFFILIATE FOR VIOLATION OF CODE OF ETHICS FOR HAVING KNOWLEDGE OF A VIOLATION AND NOT REPORTING."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN MY ROLE AS A WEALTH MANAGEMENT ADVISOR, AND IN MY BEST EFFORT TO SERVE U.S. BANK AND THE CLIENT, I HAD BEEN DILIGENTLY WORKING WITH MY BOSS MARIE WISEMAN (AS OUR TEAM DID NOT HAVE A BANKING SPECIALIST AT THAT TIME) FOR THE CREDIT GROUP TO CREATE A SHORT-TERM LOAN FACILITY FOR PAUL AND LISA SMOOT, WHOSE HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT HAD MATURED.  THE SMOOTS INDICATED THEY COULD NOT REPAY THEIR LOAN AND NEEDED ADDITIONAL TIME TO RAISE FUNDS IN ORDER TO REPAY U.S. BANK. THESE CLIENTS HAD NO RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR GROUP OTHER THAN THIS 5-YEAR BALLOON HELOC FOR $350K. THE CLIENTS WERE THE SON AND DAUGHTER-IN-LAW OF A LARGE COMMERCIAL BANKING RELATIONSHIP AND THIS HELOC WAS AN ACCOMODATION OF THIS RELATIONSHIP.  IN ORDER TO COLLATERALIZE THIS LOAN, US BANK REQUIRED A PLEDGE OF THEIR SECURITIES ACCOUNT THAT WAS HELD BY UBS (VALUED AT $150K) AS WELL AS LIENS ON THEIR TWO HOMES. THE ISSUE APPEARS TO BE THAT THE ACCOUNT TRANSFER FORM FOR THIS TRANSACTION WAS NOT COMPLETELY FILLED OUT WHEN THE CLIENT SIGNED IT. DURING THE MEETING WITH THE CLIENT, I INCLUDED ALL THE INFORMATION I HAD AT HAND, INCLUDING THE SYMBOL OF APPLE STOCK, WHICH REPRESENTED 90% OF THE PORTFOLIO. MARIE WISEMAN, MY BOSS (WHO WAS ALSO TERMINATED) TOOK THESE FORMS BACK TO HER OFFICE AND, AS I LATER LEARNED, SHE AUTHORIZED HER ASSISTANT TO INCLUDE THE UBS ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND THE MISSING STOCK SYMBOLS (VALUED AT $21K) IN ORDER TO PROCESS THE PAPERWORK. THE CLIENT SUFFERED NO DAMAGES AS THE STOCK WAS TRANSFERRED IN KIND TO USBI AND THEN BACK TO UBS AFTER THE CLIENT NOTIFIED US BANK OF THE MISCOMMUNICATION.   U.S. BANK HAS ACCUSED ME OF KNOWING THAT MY BOSS, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE, MADE A VIOLATION AND THAT I DID NOT REPORT HER. AGAIN, I DID NOT BELIEVE THIS WAS A VIOLATION AS THE CLIENT HAD AGREED TO THESE TERMS.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THIS LOAN HAS GONE TO THE COLLECTIONS DEPARTMENT AT U.S. BANK.""
