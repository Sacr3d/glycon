  ""Broker Comment"" : ""A thorough review of the customer's financial situation, investment experience and investment objective was completed for the recommendation of these funds. Also, the customer made an additional contribution into the fund while in the investment. The presented investments comported with the customer's stated objectives and the customer decided to exit the investments, which was contrary to the intentions represented at the time of sale. I deny all allegations as the alleged damages are without merit.""
