KNOWING THAT MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES MONITOR ACTIVITY IN THEIR FAMILY OF MUTUAL FUNDS AND RESTRICT EXCESSIVE TRADING, DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN A FRAUDULENT SCHEME TO DISGUISE THEIR MARKET TIMING TRADING, AND THEREBY CIRCUMVENTED TRADING RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE FUND COMPANIES. SPECIFICALLY, DEFENDANTS ROUTINELY AND SYSTEMATICALLY CONCEALED THEIR OWN IDENTITIES AND THE IDENTITY OF THE HEDGE FUND, AND CREATED MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS FOR THE HEDGE FUND AND USED SEVERAL BROKER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS TO PROCESS MARKET TIMING TRADES, DIVIDED TRADES INTO AMOUNTS DESIGNED TO EVADE DETECTION, AND USED DIFFERENT BRANCH IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS TO DISGUISE THEIR TRADING ACTIVITY. USING THESE FRAUDULENT TACTICS, DEFENDANTS PLACED THOUSANDS OF MARKET TIMING TRADES FOR HEDGE FUND THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN REJECTED BY THE FUND COMPANIES. AS A RESULT, DEFENDANTS CAUSED HARM TO MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES AND THEIR SHAREHOLDERS BY DILUTING THE VALUE OF THE MUTUAL FUND SHARES AND INCREASING THE TRANSACTION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THE MUTUAL FUNDS. DEFENDANT RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY $112,871 IN ILL-GOTTEN GAINS DERIVING FROM THE CONDUCT ALLEGED HEREIN."",
