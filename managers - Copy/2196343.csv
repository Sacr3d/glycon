  ""Allegations"" : ""I HANDLED [CUSTOMER'S] NON-DISCRETIONARY ACCOUNT AT JP MORGAN FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS, WITHOUT INCIDENT. [CUSTOMER]WAS A SOPHISTICATED AND AGRESSIVE INVESTOR WITH A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR NET WORTH. MR. [CUSTOMER] INSTRUCTED ME TO INVEST AGGRESSIVELY IN TECHNOLOGY STOCKS IN ORDER TO REAP SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN HIS ACCOUNT. [CUSTOMER] AND I SPOKE AND MET FACE TO FACE FREQUENTLY. [CUSTOMER]AUTHORIZED EACH TRADE IN ADVANCE, RECEIVED PROMPT CONFIRMATIONS OF EACH TRADE, AND NEVER OBJECTED TO ANY TRADE. [CUSTOMER'S] TRADING STRATEGY WAS AT TIMES SUCCESSFUL, BUT OVERALL HE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT NET LOSSES, AS A RESULT OF HIS SPECULATIVE TRADES AND A DOWNTURN IN THE MARKET. AT NO TIME DID [CUSTOMER] EVER EXPRESS DISPLEASURE TO ME, OR TO MY KNOWLEDGE TO JP MORGAN, REGARDING THE HANDLING OF HIS ACCOUNT. IN THE SPRING OF 2002, 6 MONTHS AFTER I LEFT JP MORGAN, AND TWO AND A HALF YEARS AFTER [CUSTOMER] TERMINATED HIS JP MORGAN ACCOUNT, I WAS ADVISED BY JP MORGAN THAT [CUSTOMER'S]LAWYER HAD ORALLY INFORMED JP MORGAN THAT HE WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE HANDLING OF HIS ACCOUNT. [CUSTOMER]DID NOT PUT ANY SUCH COMPLAINT IN WRITING. IN THE SUMMER OF 2002 I WAS INFORMED BY JP MORGAN THAT IT HAD AGREED TO MEDIATE THE DISPUTE. I WAS NOT A PARTY TO THE MEDIATION.  I WAS LATER ADVISED THAT JP MORGAN HAD AGREED TO PAY [CUSTOMER] $700,000 TO SETTLE THE DISPUTE. I WAS NOT ADVISED BEFORE THE AGREEMENT OF THE SETTLEMENT. MOREOVER, I WAS INFORMED BY JP MORGAN THAT I HAD TO PAY $75,000 TOWARD THE SETTLEMENT, WHICH I RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO DO.  I KNOW THAT JP MORGAN DID NOT SETTLE THE DISPUTE BECAUSE OF ANY WRONGDOING BY IT OR ME, RATHER, I WAS TOLD THAT THE SETTLEMENT OCCURRED SOLELY BECAUSE OF THE RISKS AND EXPENSE OF LITIGATION."",
