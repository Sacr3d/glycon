  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The rep met with the client to review his accounts on February 5th, 2016. During their meeting, the rep and the client agreed that the client wanted and needed to be more conservative with his investments and thus wanted a more balanced and structured portfolio. They agreed to move the client's portfolio to an advisory program account. This led to an agreement for certain securities to be sold and certain securities to be kept. The trades were placed at no commission. Trade confirmations and monthly statements were mailed detailing this activity and the client did not reach out to the rep's office with any objections. New account paperwork was mailed to the client to open an advisory program account. The paperwork was never returned and thus subsequent purchases to be made into the new advisory program account were never made. The rep's office left three messages with the client on his cell phone (on 02/17/16, 02/18/16 and 02/23/16) saying that they had not received the advisory account paperwork. The client never returned any of these phone calls.  The rep did not hear back from the client until 2 months after the liquidation occurred to ask additional questions. By this time the stock market had moved up 1,337 points.""
