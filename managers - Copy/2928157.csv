  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN MAY OF 2007, THE CUSTOMER REQUESTED A MEETING WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE TO INVEST $100,000 WHICH WAS A PORTION OF THE FUNDS THAT SHE AND HER HUSBAND RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF A HOME. THE CUSTOMER INFORMED THE REPRESENTATIVE THAT HER HUSBAND HAD TAKEN PART OF THEIR MONEY AND INVESTED IT WITH A BROKER WITHOUT TELLING HER OR INCLUDING HER IN THE DECISION MAKING AND THAT SHE WANTED TO DO THE SAME THING. THE CUSTOMER INFORMED THE REPRESENTATIVE THAT HER HUSBAND WAS STILL WORKING UP NORTH AND WOULD BE RETIRING SOON. THE REPRESENTATIVE PROFILED THE CUSTOMER AND BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED AT THAT TIME IT WAS DETERMINED THAT SHE HAD AN INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OF TAX SHELTERED GROWTH. THE CLIENT INFORMED THE REPRESENTATIVE THAT SHE HAD NO NEED FOR THE FUNDS AND THAT THIS WAS AN AMOUNT THAT SHE COULD INVEST WITHOUT THE NEED FOR 100% LIQUIDITY. THE REPRESENTATIVE EXPLAINED ALL FEES AND CHARGES OF THE ANNUITY TO THE CUSTOMER TO INCLUDE PENALTY FREE WITHDRAWALS AND THE SURRENDER SCHEDULE. THE REPRESENTATIVE ALSO EXPLAINED THE LIVING AND DEATH BENEFITS OF THE ANNUITY TO INCLUDE THE MGIB RIDER. THE CUSTOMER LEFT AND CAME BACK LATER IN THE AFTERNOON TO GO OVER THE DETAILS OF THE ANNUITY ONE MORE TIME AND TO SIGN THE PAPERWORK. THE REPRESENTATIVE ALSO TOLD THE CLIENT THAT IF SHE WANTED THE REPRESENTATIVE TO, THAT HE WOULD EXPLAIN THE DETAILS OF THE INVESTMENT TO HER HUSBAND.""
