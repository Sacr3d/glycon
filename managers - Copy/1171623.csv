  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MR. KURTYKA CHANGED EMPLOYERS. BECAUSE OF THIS CHANGE HE WAS REQUIRED TO RE APPLY FOR REGISTRATION AS A SALESPERSON AND INVESTMENT ADVISER REPRESENTATIVE IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.  ON FEBRUARY 16, 2005, PRIOR TO BECOMING EMPLOYED AT ADVANCED EQUITIES, INC., MR. KURTYKA SETTLED NASD DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDING NO. CAF040067.  AS PART OF THAT SETTLEMENT HE ACCEPTED A 30-DAY SUSPENSION. THE STATE OF ILLINOIS' CURRENT POLICY IS THAT IT WILL NOT REGISTER ANY APPLICANT THAT HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BY THE NASD, IF THE SUSPENSION WAS WITHIN 2 YEARS OF APPLICATION.  THE STATE OF ILLINOIS DENIED MR. KURTYKA'S APPLICATION BASED SOLELY ON THE FACT OF HIS NASD SUSPENSION. THE STATE OF ILLINOIS CONDUCTED NO SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW OF MR. KURTYKA'S APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION OTHER THAN TO CONFIRM HIS NASD SUSPENSION.""
