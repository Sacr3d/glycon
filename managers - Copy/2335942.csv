  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In response to the client's customer complaint, any and all accusations and allegations are false, misleading, and frivolous and have no basis in fact. These allegations were brought once the client removed his accounts from my advising. I deny these allegations and accusations in their entirety.  The client, as well as many of his family members, had multiple accounts with me for a period spanning two decades. Throughout this period, all of the client's accounts, as well as any family accounts, were profitable. For 20 years neither the client, nor any family member, expressed any concerns, unhappiness, or complaints. The client also had an online trading account which was unknown to me where the client duplicated my recommendations. Additionally, phone records, in-person meetings, and other documentation strongly refute any allegation of unauthorized trading.   Once again, all accounts were profitable and not one complaint was filed by the client for a period spanning two decades.  Neither Hilliard Lyons nor I admitted any wrongdoing.""
