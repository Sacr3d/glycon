  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I HAD WRITTEN A CHECK TO COSTCO IN AUGUST OF 2008. THE CHECK HAD NOT CLEARED THROUGH THE BANK. I HAD RECIEVED A LETTER THAT THE CHECK HAD NOT CLEARED AND WENT TO COSTCO AND PAID THE CHECK. THIS WAS THEN INADVERTENTLY FORWARDED ON THE MARICOPA COUNTY CHECK ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT THE CHECK HAD NOT BEEN PAID. I WAS PULLED OVER FOR A TRAFFIC VIOLATION AND INFORMED THAT I HAD A WARRANT FOR MY ARREST FOR AN INSUFFICIENT FUNDS CHECK, WHICH IS A MISDEMEANOR. I POSTED A $150.00 BOND AND HAVE A COURT DATE FOR 09/28/2009. SINCE THEN I HAVE CONTACTED COSTCO WHO HAS SENT A LETTER TO THE MARICOPA COUNTY CHECK ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND LET THEM KNOW THAT I HAD PAID THE CHECK AND THAT NO CHARGES SHOULD BE FILED AGAINST ME. I STILL HAVE TO GO TO THE COURT DATE TO GET MY BOND BACK AND TO HAVE THIS OFFICIALLY RESOLVED.""
