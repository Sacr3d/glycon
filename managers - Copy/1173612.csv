  ""Allegations"" : ""FINRA RULE 2010, NASD RULES 2110, 3010: A MEMBER FIRM, ACTING THROUGH ARCECI, ITS CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND CHIEF LEGAL COUNSEL, APPROVED A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERING TO BE SOLD BY THE FIRM'S REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES. THE APPROVAL FOR SALE WAS BASED EXCLUSIVELY ON THE REVIEW OF THE ISSUER'S UNVERIFIED AND UNCORROBORATED STATEMENTS IN THE OFFERING DOCUMENT. THE FIRM, THROUGH ARCECI, DESIGNATED A FIRM REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE TO CONDUCT THE MARKETING REVIEW FOR THE OFFERING. THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE CREATED A SUMMARY REPORT BY CUTTING AND PASTING LANGUAGE DIRECTLY FROM THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM (PPM), INCLUDING A STATEMENT ABOUT THE UNBLEMISHED PAYMENT HISTORY OF THE ISSUER'S AFFILIATES. THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE COMPLETED, SIGNED AND DATED THE REQUISITE 18-QUESTION MARKETING REVIEW CHECKLIST. THE FIRM, THROUGH ARCECI, DESIGNATED ANOTHER FIRM REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE TO CONDUCT THE DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW OF THE OFFERING. THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE USED THE OTHER REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE'S SUMMARY REPORT AND THE PPM TO CONDUCT THE DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW FOR THE OFFERING, INCLUDING HIS ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS OF THE OFFERING. THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE COMPLETED, SIGNED AND DATED THE REQUISITE 14-QUESTION DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW CHECKLIST. THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH ARCECI, APPROVED THE OFFERING FOR SALE AFTER RECEIVING THE PPM, TWO CHECKLISTS, AND SUMMARY REPORT, WHICH WAS BASED SOLELY ON THE PPM. THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH ARCECI, FAILED TO ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE THE FIRM'S DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW OF THE OFFERING IN THAT IT: FAILED TO OBTAIN OR REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE ISSUER, WHICH WOULD HAVE INFORMED IT IN MORE DETAIL OF THE LIQUIDITY ISSUES OF THE ISSUER'S AFFILIATES; FAILED TO RESEARCH THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE ISSUER'S OFFICERS, WHICH WOULD HAVE INFORMED IT THAT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER HAD BEEN BARRED FROM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND LATER CHARGED WITH FRAUD; AND FAILED TO USE THE SERVICES OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PROVIDERS THAT CONDUCTED DUE DILIGENCE REPORTS AND DRAFTED REPORTS WHICH IDENTIFIED \""MATERIAL RISK\"" OF THE LATER ISSUER OFFERINGS. THE FIRM'S INITIAL DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW, WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN LESS THAN THREE DAYS, WAS BASED SOLELY ON THE SELF-SERVING REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE ISSUER IN THE PPM. THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH ARCECI, FAILED TO ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE THE SALE OF THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERING AFTER LEARNING ABOUT DELAYS IN RETURNING PRINCIPALS TO NOTE-HOLDERS. AFTER RECEIVING AND REVIEWING AN EMAIL AND LETTER FROM THE VICE-PRESIDENT AT THE ISSUER INFORMING OF ADDITIONAL DELAYS IN THE RETURN OF PRINCIPAL, THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH ARCECI, FAILED TO ADEQUATELY FOLLOW UP ON THE RED FLAGS RAISED IN THE COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OFFERING BY FAILING TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE LIQUIDITY ISSUES DESCRIBED IN THE COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE ISSUER. AMONG OTHER THINGS, ARCECI FAILED TO: OBTAIN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR OTHER DOCUMENTATION FROM THE ISSUER TO CORROBORATE ITS SELF-SERVING ASSERTION OF A \""TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY ISSUE;\"" OBTAIN A THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE REPORT; CONTACT FIRM CUSTOMERS WHO HAD INVESTED IN A PRIOR OFFERING TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CUSTOMERS HAD RECEIVED CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE ISSUER REGARDING THE DELAY AND RECEIVED REPAYMENT OF THEIR PRINCIPAL; AND CONTACT THE ISSUER'S OFFICERS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT ITS PROBLEMS WITH MEETING INTEREST PAYMENTS ON PRIOR OFFERINGS. ALTHOUGH THE CORRESPONDENCE ALERTED THE FIRM THAT THE ISSUER'S AFFILIATE HAD MISSED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS TO INVESTORS, THE FIRM, ACTING THROUGH ARCECI, FAILED TO SUPERVISE THE ONGOING SALES OF THE OFFERING.

  ""Regulator Statement"" : ""[CONTINUED FROM ALLEGATIONS]: SPECIFICALLY, ARCECI FAILED TO: SUSPEND THE FIRM'S SALE OF THE OFFERING, AS LONG AS THOSE SALES USED A PPM WHICH FALSELY STATED THAT THE ISSUER'S AFFILIATE HAD NOT DEFAULTED ON ITS OBLIGATIONS; PROVIDE FIRM CUSTOMERS WHO HAD INVESTED IN ISSUER PRODUCTS WITH COPIES OF THE CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE ISSUER, OR REQUIRE THE FIRM'S REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES TO DISCLOSE TO EXISTING AND NEW INVESTORS OF THE OFFERING THAT THERE WERE DELAYS IN RETURN OF PRINCIPAL TO A PRIOR OFFERING'S NOTE HOLDERS; ENSURE HE TIMELY RECEIVED ALL CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE ISSUER AND ANY INFORMATION REGARDING FURTHER LIQUIDITY ISSUES, DEFAULTS, OR DELAYED PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE OFFERINGS; INSTRUCT THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE WHO RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM THE ISSUER ON HOW TO MONITOR THE SITUATION AT THE ISSUER BASED ON THE NEW INFORMATION; AND INSTRUCT THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE WHO HAD CONDUCTED THE INITIAL DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL DUE DILIGENCE IN LIGHT OF THE NEW INFORMATION. THE FIRM'S PRESIDENT PLACED THE OFFERING ON THE FIRM'S \""DO NOT SELL LIST\"" AFTER RECEIVING AN UNSOLICITED EMAIL FROM A THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE FIRM AND THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) SUED THE ISSUER, AFFILIATES AND INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANIES ALLEGING THEY COMMITTED FRAUD IN THE SALE AND OFFER OF THE SECURITIES.  WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE ALLEGATIONS, ARCECI CONSENTED TO THE DESCRIBED SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS; THEREFORE, HE IS FINED $10,000 AND SUSPENDED FROM ASSOCIATION WITH ANY FINRA MEMBER IN ANY PRINCIPAL CAPACITY FOR 10 BUSINESS DAYS. THE SUSPENSION IS IN EFFECT FROM DECEMBER 19, 2011 THROUGH JANUARY 3, 2012. FINE PAID IN FULL DECEMBER 12, 2011.""
