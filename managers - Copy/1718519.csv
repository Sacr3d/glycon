  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN SAN FRANCISCO, CA. WHEN I WAS A COLLEGE STUDENT, I HAD BEEN SHOPPING WITH A FRIEND IN A DEPARTMENT STORE. WE HAD BEEN TRYING A FEW ITEMS ON WHEN I DECIDED TO FIND A BLOUSE IN A DIFFERENT SIZE. I, THEREFORE, LEFT THE DRESSING ROOM LEAVING MY PURSE AND PACKAGES BEHIND. APPARENTLY, AFTER I LEFT THE DRESSING ROOM, MY FRIEND PUT A BLOUSE (APPROXIMATELY $30.00 -$40.00) INTO ONE OF MY PACKAGES. AS WE WERE LEAVING THE STORE, WE WERE BOTH STOPPED AND ARRESTED FOR SHOPLIFTING (PETTY THEFT). ALTHOUGH I DID NOT PLACE THE MERCHANDISE IN MY BAG BUT WAS CARRYING IT, I WAS ASSUMED GUILTY. BECAUSE I HAD NO PRIOR RECORD, MY CHARGE WAS DISMISSED.""
