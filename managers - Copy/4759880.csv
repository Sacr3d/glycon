  ""Type"" : ""SHORT SALE"",
  ""Disposition"" : ""CLOSED"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN THE MIDST OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AFTER 2008, OUR HOME LOAN RATE WAS EXCEEDINGLY BURDENSOME. I HAD TO LOOK AT OTHER JOB OPPORTUNITIES THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO PERFORM A JOB OUT OF THE STATE OF MY RESIDENCE. I FOUND A JOB AT MASSMUTUAL IN MAY 2011. WE TRIED MANY AVENUES TO STAY IN OUR HOME BUT HAD TO PUT THE HOUSE UP FOR SALE, BUT AFTER MANY MONTHS WE HAD NO OFFERS. WE FINALLY DECIDED TO CONSULT WITH A REAL ESTATE AGENT REGARDING THE SHORT SALE PROCESS. AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OUR MORTGAGE COMPANY RELENTED AND OUR REAL ESTATE BROKER FOUND A PARTNERSHIP WITH AN INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS WILLING TO MAKE AN OFFER. THIS SHORT SALE PROCESS WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY. WE RECEIVED A DOCUMENT FROM OUR MORTGAGE COMPANY CONDITIONS AND TERMS, IT WAS UNSIGNED. ON NOVEMBER 12 WE RECEIVED A LETTER NOTIFYING US THAT OUR HOME OWNER'S POLICY HAD BEEN CANCELLED. THIS WAS OUR FIRST CONFIRMATION THAT THE SHORT SALE HAD BEEN COMPLETED AS WE STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY FINAL DOCUMENTATION FROM OUR MORTGAGE SERVICING COMPANY.""
