  ""Broker Comment"" : ""At the time the representative certified to his CE credits, he believed he had met all required credits to renew his MN license. It was his belief that he only needed 12 CE credits for his MN license, and that his completion of 12 Firm CE credits satisfied his MN CE credits. He later learned that he was required to complete 24 CE credits to renew his state license, and that the 12 Firm CE credits were non-transferrable.  The representative has completed the required 24 CE credits.""
