WHILE THE STATE OF FLORIDA HAS IMPOSED A STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD AGAINST THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE, THE ERROR WAS ON THE PART OF THE FIRM AND ITS FAILURE TO PROPERLY REGISTER THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE WAS REGISTERED PROPERLY AS A SECURITIES AGENT WITH THE STATE OF FLORIDA DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD.  IN ADDITION, TO THE BEST OF THE FIRM'S KNOWLEDGE, THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE WAS PROPERLY REGISTERED IN OTHER TERRITORIES IN WHICH HE CONDUCTED BUSINESS DURING THE RELEVANT TIME PERIOD.""
