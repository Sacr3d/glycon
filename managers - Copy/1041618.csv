  ""Broker Comment"" : ""AFTER INVESTIGATION, LEGG MASON WOOD WALKER INC. FOUND THE CLAIM TO BE WITH OUT MERIT.  THE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES RESULTED FROM THE THE HOLDING OF A SINGLE STOCK (PURCHASED AT THE REQUEST OF THE CLIENT) WHICH REPRESENTED 88% OF THE PORTFOLIO.  AFTER IGNORING REQUESTS TO LIQUIDATE PART OF THE POSITION, THE CLIENT PURCHASED AN ADDITIONAL 1000 SHARES.  THESE PURCHASES WERE UNSOLICITED AND FILLED AT THE REQUEST OF THE CLIENT.  THE POSITION CURRENTLY HAS NO MARKET VALUE WHICH GREATLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE LOSSES IN THE ACCOUNT.  ALSO, THE CLAIM OF DAMAGES DOES NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION DISBURSED FUNDS IN EXCESS OF $300,000 AT THE REQUEST OF THE CLIENT.  AS OF THIS WRITING, LEGG MASON CLOSED THE COMPLAINT WITH NO FURTHER ACTION REQUIRED.""
