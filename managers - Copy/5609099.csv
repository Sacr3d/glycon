  ""Firm Name"" : ""VALIC FINANCIAL ADVISORS, INC."",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Permitted to Resign"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""Permitted to resign after allegations of failure to disclose outside business activity."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The \""permitted to resign\"" designation on my U5 is misleading.  VALIC never informed me, nor was I otherwise aware, of any pending termination related to my OBA while at VALIC.  I voluntarily disclosed the OBA in question during an internal audit approximately 5 - 6 months prior to my departure.  I voluntarily left VALIC to pursue another opportunity with another Broker Dealer.  The proper designation for my U5 under \""Termination Type\"" should read \""voluntary\"".  The allegation, if any are necessary, should read failure to \""properly\"" disclose outside business activity.""
