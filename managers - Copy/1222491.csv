ALTHOUGH AT THE TIME THE CLIENT APPEARED AWARE OF AND AUTHORIZED THE TRADES, SUBSEQUENT ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENT OF THE STOCK RESULTED IN A CUSTOMER COMPLAINT. IN THE SETTLEMENT WITH THE NASD I AGREED THAT MY OBLIGATIONS AS A SUPERVISOR INCLUDE ASSURING THAT REPRESENTATIVE REFRAIN FROM EXECUTING TRANSACTION FOR CUSTOMER WHICH WOULD RESULT IN EXCESSIVE CONCENTRATIONS.""
