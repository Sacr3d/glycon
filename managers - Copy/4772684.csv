  ""Allegations"" : ""WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, MILLER CONSENTED TO THE SANCTIONS AND TO THE ENTRY OF FINDINGS THAT SHE PARTICIPATED IN PRIVATE SALES OF $764,500 WORTH OF A COMPANY'S SECURITIES FOR WHICH SHE EARNED COMMISSIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $38,225. THE FINDINGS STATED THAT SIX CUSTOMERS OF ONE OF MILLER'S MEMBER FIRMS PURCHASED THE COMPANY'S NOTES FROM HER AND AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE CUSTOMERS BELIEVED THAT HE WAS PURCHASING A PRODUCT THAT THE FIRM WAS RECOMMENDING. MILLER DID NOT NOTIFY EITHER OF HER MEMBER FIRMS OF HER PARTICIPATION, AND DID NOT OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM EITHER FIRM TO PARTICIPATE, IN THE PRIVATE SECURITY SALES. THE FINDINGS ALSO STATED THAT THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES WERE NOT REGISTERED AT THE TIME MILLER PARTICIPATED IN THEIR SALE, NOR WAS THERE ANY APPLICABLE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION. THUS, BY SELLING THE COMPANY SECURITIES, MILLER PARTICIPATED IN AN UNREGISTERED DISTRIBUTION OF SECURITIES IN CONTRAVENTION OF SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. THE FINDINGS ALSO INCLUDED THAT MILLER RECOMMENDED THE COMPANY SECURITIES TO INVESTORS WITHOUT HAVING CONDUCTED ADEQUATE DUE DILIGENCE AND WITHOUT HAVING A REASONABLE BASIS FOR BELIEVING THAT THE SECURITIES WERE SUITABLE FOR THOSE INVESTORS."",
