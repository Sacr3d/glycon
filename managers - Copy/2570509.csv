  ""Allegations"" : ""Alleged Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Negligence, Negligent Misrepresentation, Fraud, and Violation of N.C. Gen Stat. \\u00a775-1.1. The claimant alleges Mr.  Yarbrough recommended claimant transfer funds from an IRA of which claimant was a beneficiary, to an inherited IRA to avoid immediate taxation.  The beneficiary claim was requested in the form of a lump sum payment instead of trustee to trustee transfer, with instructions to withhold funds for taxes which the claimant alleges were later fraudulently edited by Mr. Yarbrough.  The claimant was notified of the taxable distribution by the insurance company. The claimant stated that he notified Mr. Yarbrough and that Mr. Yarbrough indicated he would fix the error. The claimant alleges no corrective action was taken."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I acted as a fiduciary adviser for the claimant's mother for 15 years.  When the claimant's mother passed away, I assisted her two beneficiaries with the claim forms for her regular accounts and IRA accounts.  The claimant wanted to cash out of the companies that held his mother's IRA accounts and roll them into his own IRA.  The only option on the claim form to get funds away from the current company was the cash out option.  I told the claimant he needed to contact the company he was cashing out from to find out what they needed to roll the funds over to an IRA for himself.  Since his mother was deceased the companies holding her IRA accounts would not speak with me so the beneficiary had to call in to get any information.  The claimant never called and just submitted the claim form.  Once he received distribution checks, I did everything I could to get them rolled into his own IRA.  No company would accept the roll over funds and the companies that originally held the IRA accounts for his mother would not reverse and reissue for roll over purposes.  Contributory negligence by the claimant on the initial completion of the claim forms is why the IRA accounts were not rolled over to him.""
