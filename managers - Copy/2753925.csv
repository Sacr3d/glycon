  ""Broker Comment"" : ""AS THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR NAMED IN THE ORAL COMPLAINT, I AM SIGNING THE AMENDED U-4 WITH PROTEST EMPHASIZED BASED ON THE FOLLOWING:  1.THE CUSTOMER'S CLAIM IS BASELESS. THROUGHOUT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CUSTOMER, THE ACCOUNT ALWAYS MAINTAINED A MODERATE RISK, BALANCED (STOCKS/BONDS/CASH) ASSET ALLOCATION. THE MUTUAL FUNDS THE CLIENT ORDERED SOLD ON MARCH 6, 2009 (WHICH WAS A \""PANIC\"" LOW SESSION) WERE PURCHASED FOR HIM, AT NET ASSET VALUE, AT HIS REQUEST AFTER HE EXPRESSED DISCOMFORT WITH ANOTHER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ALTHOUGH THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY HAD A LIGHTER EQUITY WEIGHTING THAN HIS ORIGINAL MIX. WITH INPUT FROM HIS CPA WHO WAS ON THE PHONE CALL AS WELL, HE MADE THE DECISION TO SELL ON THAT DAY AGAINST MY RECOMMENDATION NOT TO DO SO AS THE EQUITY MARKETS WERE EXPERIENCING A HISTORICAL PANIC AND THAT HE SHOULD SELL STRATEGICALLY INTO MARKET STRENGTH. AS THE MUTUAL FUNDS WERE PURCHASED AT NAV (NO UP FRONT OR BACK END SALES CHARGES), THE CUSTOMER INCURRED NO FEES AND I RECEIVED NO COMMISSION.  THE CUSTOMER'S WEALTH WAS ACQUIRED A FEW YEARS PRIOR THROUGH A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR, PROGRESSIVE SLOT MACHINE JACKPOT AT A BILOXI, MS AREA CASINO. SUBSEQUENTLY, HE INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL LOSSES THROUGH CASINO GAMBLING, POOR BUSINESS DEALS, AND THE OVERUSE OF LEVERAGE. THE ARGUMENT THAT HE WAS PLACED IN INVESTMENTS (MOSTLY MUTUAL FUNDS) THAT WERE TOO AGGRESSIVE IS WITHOUT MERIT AS HIS GAMBLING EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT HE HAS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF RISK.  2.ON AUGUST 14TH, 2009, THE UBS BRANCH OFFICE WHERE I WAS EMPLOYED WAS SOLD TO STIFEL NICOLAUS AND COMPANY. THE CUSTOMER'S COMPLAINT WAS MADE AUGUST 25TH. AS THE TIME PERIOD STATED IN THE COMPLAINT OCCURRED WHILE I WORKED IN A UBS BRANCH, THIS WAS A UBS MATTER AND WAS HANDLED BY UBS COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL. I HAD ONE BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH JOY WEBER, AN IN-HOUSE, UBS ATTORNEY, AROUND AUGUST 27TH DURING WHICH WE REVIEWED THE MEMO I HAD WRITTEN CONCERNING THE COMPLAINT AND THE HISTORY OF MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CUSTOMER. I WAS NOT KEPT \""IN THE LOOP\"" REGARDING THE MATTER. I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM STIFEL COMPLIANCE ON JUNE 21ST WITH A PDF OF THE UPDATED U4. IT WAS THEN THAT I LEARNED THAT UBS HAD SETTLED WITH THE CUSTOMER FOR THE AMOUNT STATED ON THE FORM. I HAD NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS DECISION BY MY FORMER FIRM. SINCE THE INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH MS. WEBER, I HAVE RECEIVED NO COMMUNICATION FROM HER OR ANYONE WITH UBS LEGAL AND/OR COMPLIANCE. OTHER THAN THE MEMO AND THIS COMMENT, I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISPUTE THIS COMPLAINT AND WAS NOT KEPT ABREAST OF THE PROCEEDINGS. HAD I BEEN INFORMED OF A PENDING SETTLEMENT, I WOULD HAVE VEHEMENTLY OBJECTED.""
