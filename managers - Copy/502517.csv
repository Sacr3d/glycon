NO DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AGAINST MONAHAN OR FIRMS. NO ADDITIONAL PENALTIES. THOMAS MONAHAN WILL PAY A SUM OF 1/3 OF THE SETTLEMENT FOR THE AMOUNT OF $29,666.00. THIS DECISION WAS A TRAVESTY IN MY OPINION. THE WHOLE COMPLAINT AROSE FROM THE DECLINE IN PRICE OF A UTILITY - PUBLIC SERVICE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. PNH IS THE SUBJECT OF NUMEROUS CLASS ACTION SUITS REGARDING THE COMPANY'S DISSEMINATION OF ERRONEOUS AND MISLEADING INFORMATION. CUSTOMER AGREED TO LEVERAGE HIS INVESTMENT ON MARGIN AFTER HAVING THE RISK/REWARD RATIO EXPLAINED. I ACTED WITH HIS BEST INTEREST IN MIND AT ALL TIMES AND I'VE BEEN PENALIZED FOR A JUDGEMENT CALL. HAD THE STOCK NOT DECLINED NO ARBITRATION WOULD HAVE BEEN.""
