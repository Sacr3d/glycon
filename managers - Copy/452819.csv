  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN 1987 I THOUGHT I WANTED TO ACT AS AN INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND WENT TO CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE, TIME, AND MONEY, THE QUALIFY WITH THE S.E.C. AND QUALIF DEPT. OF CORPORATIONS. BEFORE I GOT STARTED THE MARKETS WENT HAYWIRE, AND I DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON LIFE & HEALTH INSURANCE AND OTHER GUARANTEED PRODUCTS FOR COMMISSION INCOME. I COULD NOT JUSTIFY RECEIVING COMMISSIONS AND INVMT ADVISORY FEES. THEREFORE, I HAD NO FURTHER USE FOR MY CERTIFICATION AND ALLOWED IT TO LAPSE FOR NON-PAYMENT. THIS WAS NOT A MATTER OF DISCIPLINE, IT WAS A VOLUNTARY INACTIVATION!!.""
