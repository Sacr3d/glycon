  ""Broker Comment"" : ""On 01-30-96 I was shopping at Publix Supermarket in Tallahassee, FL. I stopped at the deli while shopping in the supermarket and filled a fountain soda. I consumed the fountain soda while shopping and the empty cup was left in the shopping cart. I paid for approximately $50 of groceries, but I neglected to pay for the fountain soda. I was charged with petty theft (not grand theft $100, but less than $300 from dwelling in Leon County). I was represented by an attorney and the case was dropped. The record was supposed to be expunged and sealed. This incident was a misunderstanding and very unfortunate.""
