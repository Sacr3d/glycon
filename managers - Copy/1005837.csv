  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I thought all past debt were resolved.  I didn't know this was pending.  I thought the two envelopes were junk mail, but then I opened the mail on 11/27/19 and reported to DOC on 12/9/19.  I didn't know I was required to report this within one business day. The background check that Prudential completed didn't find this pending debt.""
