  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I CHANGED THAT BIRTH DATE ON THE ID`S TO MAKE MYSELF APPEAR TO BE 21 YEARS OF AGE INSTEAD OF MY ACTUAL AGE OF 18.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS WAS TO ATTEMPT TO PURCHASE BEER FOR AFTER MY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. THIS WAS MOST CERTAINLY A FOOLISH AND IMMATURE ACT.  AT THE TIME I DID NOT REALIZE HOW MUCH TROUBLE THAT ACT WOULD CAUSE ME.  I STRONGLY WISH THAT I WAS MATURE ENOUGH AT THE TIME NOT TO DO SUCH A THING.  PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME IF YOU NEED ANYTHING FURTHER. (PHONE #502-241-5755)""
