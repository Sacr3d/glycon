  ""Broker Comment"" : ""On June 19, 2017 my Maryland Life and Health Insurance license was suspended because I was more than 120 days delinquent on making my full child support payments.  At the time I was working as a server in Ocean City, MD which is a very seasonal resort city. Most of my earning were made July through mid September and I could not afford the $1500 a month child support payments when I only made around $25,000 for the year.  I tried to have the child support payments lowered through Maryland Child Support Services and, after 9 months, I found out they denied my request. All of the back child support has been paid and I have made the necessary payments for 3 years now.""
