  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I purchased the property as an investment that hosted a family run estate business. When I relocated to CA from MI the tenants (family) agreed to continue making monthly payments. When the economy in Detroit took a downturn they were unable to keep up the payments, and I made the payments until it became too much of a hardship. The loan was greater than the value of the property. So I requested and was granted a Dee in Lieu in 2015.""
