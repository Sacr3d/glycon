HE GAVE ME SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO LIQUIDATE HIS 529 COLLEGE ACCOUNTS AND REINVEST THE PROCEEDS INTO CASH MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED HIS INSTRUCTIONS. HE CALLED BACK LATER THAT AFTERNOON AND TOLD ME TO HOLD OFF ON HIS PRIOR INSTRUCTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS TOO LATE AND THE ASSET MIX CHANGE HAD ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED ACCORDING TO HIS PRIOR INSTRUCTIONS.""
