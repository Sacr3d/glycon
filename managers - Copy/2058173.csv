  ""Broker Comment"" : ""When assisting a client in order to add as a Power of Attorney to existing 2 brokerage accounts, I made a photocopy of an original signed internal Power of Attorney of Affidavit form in order to use for the second account without any harm or bad intentions. I was informed by my compliance officer that I will need a second original signed form rather than a photocopy. I contacted the client immediately and corrected the matter. I was told that I may receive a corrective counseling for this mistake by my Manager. However, four months later I was fired by a reason of modifying a client signed form.""
