This DRP and disclosure was originally prepared 10/05/2018 however somehow purged from system without submission.  The original Filing ID was 50035088.""

  ""Allegations"" : ""FAILURE TO FOLLOW FIRM'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES BY OBTAINING BLANK FORMS PRE-EXECUTED BY CUSTOMERS AND TRANSMITTING UNENCRYPTED  CUSTOMER INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE FIRM'S NETWORK."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""REGARDING THE BLANK FORMS PRE EXECUTED:   ON MARCH 13, I WAS CALLED INTO A MEETING WITH CHUCK WEBB, MY REGIONAL MANAGER AT ALLSTATE AND JOHN FISHER, MY OSJ MANAGER AT ALLSTATE.  WEBB AND FISHER TOLD ME THAT MEETING WAS REGARDING AND IN PREPARATION FOR A FINRA EXAM THAT WAS TO COMMENCE THE FOLLOWING MONDAY. UNKNOWN TO ME I HAD ALREADY BEEN U5'D.  THEY HAD A COPY OF MY U5 AND INFORMED ME THAT I WAS DISCHARGED STATING \""WE TRIED TO GET THIS REVERSED\"" WHEN I ASKED WHY THEY SAID \""READ THE U5\"".    I ASKED THEM \""WHAT CLIENT, WHAT DOCUMENT, WHICH FILE, SHOW ME PROOF?\""  THEY REFUSED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS STATING THE REASON FOR TERMINATION WAS ON THE U5 AND TOLD ME I HAD AN HOUR TO CLEAN OUT MY OFFICE.  PREVIOUS TO 3/13/2015 THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION FROM ALLSTATE COMPLIANCE REGARDING THIS MATTER, NO ONE EVER ASKED ME ABOUT A PARTICULAR CLIENT OR DOCUMENT AND I WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY INTERNAL INVESTIGATION OR INQUIRY.  I DENY THE ALLEGATIONS.  I HAVE NO DOCUMENTS OR CORRESPONDENCES RELATING TO THIS MATTER IN MY POSSESSION.      REGARDING TRANSMITTING CUSTOMER INFORMATION - OUTSIDE THE FIRM'S NETWORK: IN AUGUST/SEPTEMBER OF 2013 (BEST ESTIMATE) I DISCOVERED THAT SOMEHOW ONE (1) CLIENT INADVERTENTLY OBTAINED MY CLOUD (APPLE) EMAIL ADDRESS MOST LIKELY THROUGH CORRESPONDING WITH ME. I DISCOVERED THIS WHEN THE CLIENT, MICHAEL ROBSON, SENT ONE EMAIL TO ME CONTAINING SOME DOCUMENTS TO FORWARD TO AN ESTATE PLANNING ATTORNEY.  WHEN I NOTICED THE ADDRESS HE USED, I TOOK THE FOLLOWING IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE MEASURE, FIRST I CALLED THE CLIENT AND TOLD HIM TO NEVER USE THE ADDRESS AGAIN, I ASKED HIM TO WIPE THE ADDRESS OFF HIS ADDRESS BOOKS, AND NEXT I SELF REPORTED THE ISSUE TO MY OSJ MANAGER AT THE TIME, SAMUEL MOTTO.  I NEVER HEARD ABOUT THE ISSUE AGAIN.   IN FACT IF I DIDN'T SELF REPORT IT ALLSTATE MAY HAVE NEVER KNOWN ABOUT IT AS THE CLIENT WASN'T COMPLAINING IT WAS A ONE-TIME EVENT.   THIS INCIDENT WAS NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO AND ALL DOCUMENTATION WAS IN THE FILE AND REPORTED TO A SUPERVISOR. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IF IT'S CONSIDERED \""REPORTABLE\"" IT HAS TO BE DONE PROMPTLY AFTER THE ISSUE HAPPENED, NOT NEARLY TWO YEARS LATER.    THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT HAPPENED I TOOK IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE MEASURES AND I SELF REPORTED THE ISSUE.  I HAVE NO DOCUMENTS OR CORRESPONDENCES RELATING TO THIS MATTER IN MY POSSESSION.    I DECLARE THAT THE STATEMENTS ABOVE ARE TRUE.  IN SUMMARY, I HAVE BEEN A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS AND I HAVE HAD A LONG AND RELATIVELY PROBLEM-FREE CAREER.  THE ISSUES DISCLOSED ARE NOT CUSTOMER RELATED BUT RATHER ADMINISTRATIVE.  I HAVE NOT HAD ANY CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS, EVER.  SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME.""
