  ""Allegations"" : ""IA Release 40-4962 / July 10, 2018:   The Securities and Exchange Commission (\""Commission\"") deems it appropriate and in the public interest that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\""Advisers Act\"") against Brian S. Eyster (\""Eyster\"" or \""Respondent\"").    The Commission finds that these proceedings arise out of Eyster's causing violations of the testimonial rule under the Advisers Act, which states that it shall constitute a fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act, practice, or course of business for any investment adviser registered with the Commission to publish, circulate or distribute any advertisement which refers to, among other things, any testimonial of any kind concerning the investment adviser. Eyster caused ON Investment Management Co. (\""ONIMCO\"") to violate the testimonial rule under the Advisers Act by publishing on the internet advertisements containing testimonials concerning Eyster and the investment advice and services he renders as an investment adviser representative of ONIMCO. The testimonials were available to the public on, among other places, YouTube.com and a website Eyster maintained for his business. By publishing statements containing client testimonials, Eyster caused ONIMCO's violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-1(a)(1) thereunder."",
