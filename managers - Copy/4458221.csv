  ""Broker Comment"" : ""There are no hard copies of this incident all files were destroyed at the courthouse.  I MET MY ROOMMATE AT BROOKWOOD MALL IN THE MTN.BROOK AREA.  WHEN I ARRIVED DEE HAD ALREADY DONE SOME SHOPPING AT RICH'S.  SHE HAD NUMEROUS PACKAGES AND STATED SHE WOULD LEAVE SOME WITH ME WHILE SHE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND PUT A NAME ON RESERVATION FOR DINNER .  I COMPLETED MY SHOPPING AND PAID FOR MY ITEMS AND PROCEEDED TO LEAVE.  THE SECURITY OFFICER ASKED ME TO COME WITH HIM TO THE STORE OFFICE WHERE THEY WERE HOLDING DEE.  THE PACKAGES I WAS CARRYING FOR DEE HAD UNPAID MERCHANDISE IN THEM AS WELL AS SOME SHE HAD IN HER POSSESSION.  SHE NEVER ADMITTED THAT SHE HAD NOT PAID FOR THEM, BUT SHE DID NOT HAVE THE RECEIPTS.  SO I WAS ALSO CHARGED.""
