  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Not Provided THE OTHER REPRESENTATIVE INVOLVED INTENDED TO RESIGN FROM HIS BROKER DEALER (HE RESIGNED EFFECTIVE JULY 20, 1994), AND BECAME LICENSED WITH FNIC. I DID NOT KNOW AND WAS NEVER TOLD IT WAS A NASD VIOLATION TO WORK JOINTLY WITH A REPRESENTATIVE OF ANOTHER BROKER DEALER. IN FACT, OUR FIRM ASKED THE N.C. SECRETARY OF STATES OFFICE ABOUT THIS. WE RECEIVED A WRITTEN RESPONSE THAT IN FACT WE COULD WORK JOINTLY AND SHARE COMMISSIONS WITH A REPRESENTATIVE OF ANOTHER BROKER DEALER. I REALIZE NOW THAT THIS WAS A VIOLATION. ANY VIOLATION THAT OCCURRED WAS NOT INTENTIONAL, BUT WAS BASED ON MISINFORMATION RECEIVED FROM MY SECRETARY OF STATE. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE CUSTOMER WAS UNHARMED.""
