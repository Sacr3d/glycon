  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I received a partial release for this debt when I sold my house in September 2011. To the best of my knowledge, this debt was paid by my ex business partner at or about that time. The subject debt was incurred entirely by my former partner, without my knowledge or consent, 2 years after I had transferred all interest in that company on 12-31-2007. I am only associated with the debt due to my former partner's unauthorized utilization of a business account that I had personally guaranteed while I was still associated with that company.  During a recent refinance of my home, I discovered on 11-23-2015, the subject debt was still unpaid and received another partial release.""
