  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 18505, DECEMBER 12, 2003; RESPONDENTS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THEIR MEMBER FIRM  MISREPRESENTED AND OMITTED TO STATE MATERIAL FACTS IN THE OFFER AND SALE OF SHARES OF TWO OF THESE FUNDS REGARDING THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUNDS, THE CREDIT RESEARCH PERFORMED ON THE BONDS PURCHASED AND HELD BY THE FUNDS, THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE BONDS HELD IN THE FUNDS AND THE LIQUIDITY OF THE FUNDS. DEFENDANTS ALSO FRAUDULENTLY PRICED BONDS IN THESE FUNDS, WITH THE RESULT THAT THE FUNDS' SHARES WERE SOLD AT INCORRECT PER-SHARE NET ASSET VALUES (\""NAVS\""). A FUND'S NAV IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF INFORMATION FOR ANY INVESTOR IN THAT FUND AS IT REPRESENTS THE CLOSING \""PRICE\"" OF EACH OF THE FUND'S SHARES. IF THE FUND'S DAILY NAV IS OVERSTATED ON A GIVEN DAY, INVESTORS WHO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE FUND ON THAT DAY PAY TOO MUCH RELATIVE TO THE FUND'S ACTUAL ASSETS, WHILE SHAREHOLDERS REDEEMING THEIR SHARES ON THAT DAY RECEIVE MORE THAN THEY ARE ENTITLED TO RELATIVE TO THE FUND'S ACTUAL ASSETS.  AS A RESULT OF THE FRAUDULENT PRICING, FROM AT LEAST AUGUST 2000 UNTIL MARCH 2001, INVESTORS IN FIRM ADVISORS' HIGH-YIELD MUNICIPAL BOND FUND (\""HIGH-YIELD FUND\"") AND SHORT DURATION HIGH-YIELD MUNICIPAL FUND (\""SHORT DURATION FUND\"") (COLLECTIVELY, \""THE FUNDS\"") PURCHASED SHARES OF THE FUNDS AT INCORRECT NAVS. AS A FURTHER RESULT OF THE FRAUDULENT PRICING, THE FIRM WAS FORCED TO RADICALLY DEVALUE THE BONDS HELD IN THE FUNDS ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2000 (\""SEPTEMBER DEVALUATION\"") AND AGAIN ON OCTOBER 13, 2000 (\""OCTOBER DEVALUATION\"") IN ORDER TO GENERATE SALES OF THOSE BONDS AND KEEP THE FUNDS SOLVENT."",
