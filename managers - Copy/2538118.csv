SHE WANTED AN IMMEDIATE MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION SO I INVESTED HER MONEY IN THE FRANKLIN INCOME FUND THAT PAID A MONTHLY  DIVIDEND.  WE SET UP SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWALS.  ABOUT THE 10TH MONTH THE CLIENT BEGAN TAKING ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTIONS, 44 EXTRA IN TOTAL OVER THE NEXT 3 YEARS.  I REVIEWED HER ACCOUNT WITH HER EVERY YEAR AND EXPLAINED THE MONEY WOULD NOT LAST FOREVER AT THE RATE SHE WAS TAKING EXTRA DISTRIBUTIONS. IN THE 4TH YEAR SHE RAN OUT OF FUNDS AND COMPLAINED IT WAS INVESTED IMPROPERLY.  THE FIRM AGREED TO SETTLE FOR A NOMINAL AMOUNT AND I DID NOT CONTRIBUTE.""

AS THE MARKET DROPPED I CALLED HER AND WE MOVED MONEY INTO THE MARKET.  THEN LEHMAN BROTHERES DECLARED BANKRUPTCY AND THE MARKET FELL DRAMATICALLY.  THE CLIENT BEGAN TO PANIC AS THEY DID NOT REALIZE THE FUNDS WERE SUBJECT TO SOME MARKET RISK.  WHEN WE ORIGINALLY BOUGHT THE FUNDS WE WENT THROUGH DIFFERENT HYPOTHECIAL ILLUSTRATIONS BUT NOTHING COULD PREPARE US FOR THE MARKET SHOCK OF 20008. FIRM AGREED TO SETTLE AND I DID NOT CONTRIBUTE.""
