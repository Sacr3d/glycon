  ""Allegations"" : ""FLORIDA CLIENT, THROUGH HIS ATTORNEY, CLAIMED THAT HIS ACCOUNT WAS FUNDED AND ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLATERALIZING A LOAN. THE ACCOUNT WAS OPENED ON OR ABOUT SEPTEMBER 20, 2007. IN APRIL 2008, THE ACCOUNT WAS ENROLLED IN THE FIRM'S FUNDSOURCE PROGRAM, A DISCRETIONARY, MUTUAL FUND WRAP-PROGRAM MANAGED BY THE FIRM'S MANAGER STRATEGY GROUP. THE CLIENT CLAIMED THAT HE INSTRUCTED THE FA THAT THE FUNDS HAD TO BE INVESTED SAFELY IN THE ACCOUNT SINCE LOSSES COULD RESULT IN THE NEED TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR OTHER NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. THE CLIENT CLAIMS THAT, CONTRARY TO HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO INVEST THE FUNDS CONSERVATIVELY, HE INCURRED LOSSES OF MORE THAN $100,000. THE CLIENT FURTHER CLAIMED THAT THE FA DID NOT ALERT HIM TO THE LOSSES OR THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENTS THAT WERE MADE FOR HIS ACCOUNT OR THAT HE COULD TAKE DIVIDENDS FROM THE ACCOUNT IN CASH RATHER THAN REINVESTING THE DIVIDENDS. THE CLIENT ALSO CLAIMED THAT $50,000 WAS TRANSFERRED FROM HIS DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT TO HIS BROKERAGE ACCOUNT WITHOUT HIS CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE. ALLEGED DAMAGES ARE $100,000. ***LITIGATION ALLEGATIONS:  PLAINTIFF, A FLORIDA RESIDENT, ALLEGES  IN 2007 UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS WERE MADE TO HIS ACCOUNT.

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""**THE FIRM DENIED THE COMPLAINT ON AUGUST 3, 2009. BASED UPON THE FIRM'S REVIEW OF THIS MATTER, IT APPEARED THAT THE INVESTMENTS THAT WERE MADE FOR THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNT WERE CONSISTENT WITH HIS OVERALL INVESTOR PROFILE, HIS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, HIS RISK TOLERANCE, AND HIS INVESTMENT TIME HORIZON. FURTHER, IT ALSO APPEARED THAT THE ACCOUNT WAS HANDLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTROL AGREEMENT, SECURITY AGREEMENT, ETC. WHICH WERE IN EFFECT TO SECURE THE ACCOUNT AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LETTER OF CREDIT THAT WAS ISSUED TO THE CLIENT. FINALLY, THE FIRM COULD NOT CONCLUDE THAT MONIES WERE TRANSFERRED FROM THE CLIENT'S CD WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE AND/OR CONSENT. IT APPEARED THAT THE NEGATIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE CLIENT\\u00bfS INVESTMENTS IN 2008 WAS THE RESULT OF MARKET FORCES THAT WERE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF EITHER THE FIRM OR ITS ASSOCIATES.  CLIENT SIGNED A FUNDSOURCE AGREEMENT CONFIRMING THAT HIS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND RISK TOLERANCE WERE MODERATE GROWTH AND INCOME. THE CLIENT'S INVESTMENT TIME HORIZON WAS TEN YEARS OR MORE. THE CLIENT IS A HIGH NET WORTH INVESTOR. PER THE FA, AT NO TIME DID THE CLIENT, EITHER VERBALLY OR IN WRITING, MENTION THAT HE WANTED HIS PRINCIPAL GUARANTEED OR EXPRESS ANY CONCERNS ABOUT LIQUIDITY OR PRINCIPAL STABILITY. THE CLIENT'S GOAL WAS TO SEEK HIGHER TAX-FREE RETURNS THAN THAT OF CASH INSTRUMENTS IN THE LONG-TERM EVEN IF THAT MEANT ACCEPTING MORE RISK. FA REVIEWED THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNT AND INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS INVESTMENTS, WITH HIM ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS. CONTRARY TO THE CLIENT'S ALLEGATIONS, $50,000 WAS NEVER TRANSFERRED FROM THE CLIENT'S DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT TO HIS BROKERAGE ACCOUNT DURING THE RELEVANT TIME PERIOD WITH OR WITHOUT HIS CONSENT. THE CLIENT LIQUIDATED HIS ACCOUNT IN DECEMBER 2008 AND TRANSFERRED HIS FUNDS TO ANOTHER FIRM.  **WENT TO LITIGATION.""
