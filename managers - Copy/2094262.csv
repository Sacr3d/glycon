  ""Broker Comment"" : ""OBLIGATION WILL SOON BE DISCHARGED.  PAYMENT PLAN OF $4000.00 WAS ESTABLISHED IN SEPT. 2010 WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THAT NO LIEN WOULD BE FILED. A REQUEST WAS MADE THAT IF THE IRS INTENDED TO FILE A LIEN, I WOULD BE NOTIFIED SO THAT I COULD PURSUE OPTIONS TO SATISFY THE BALANCE AND AVOID THE LIEN.  THE IRS DID NOT CONTACT ME.  I HAVE REQUESTED A HEARING FOR WITHDRAWAL OF THE LIEN AND IT IS PENDING.  I EXPECT TO SATISFY THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LIEN PRIOR TO THE HEARING DATE SO I MAY HAVE THE LIEN EXPUNGED.""
