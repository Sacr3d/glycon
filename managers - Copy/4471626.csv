  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I ASSISTED IN BRINGING OVER NEW MONEY TO THE BANK, BUT BECAUSE THE CLIENT WAS MY COUSIN, THE FIRM FELT I BROKE THE RULES. THE FIRM HAS A RULE THAT STATES REGISTERED REPS CANNOT DO BUSINES WITH \""FRIENDS OR FAMILY.\"" IN MY SIX YEARS WITH THE FIRM, EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD THE RULE TO APPLY TO IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS ONLY, NOT GOING SO FAR DOWN THE FAMILY TREE THAT A COUSIN WOULD BE PERCEIVED AS AN ISSUE. I HAD FULLY DISCLOSED TO MY BRANCH AND SALES MANAGER THAT THIS CLIENT WAS A COUSIN OF MINE, AND DID NOT RECEIVE ANY SORT OF WARNING OR INSTRUCTION THAT IT MAY BE AN ISSUE. THE BANK INCENTIVE CREDIT SUBMITTED WAS FOR THE NEW MONEY THE CLIENT BROUCH TO THE FIRM THROUGH MY EFFORTS AND MY BRANCH BENEFITTING FROM THE MONEY.""
