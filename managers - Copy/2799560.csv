  ""Broker Comment"" : ""BECAUSE MY COURT DATE ON JAN 31, 1991 DID NOT INCLUDE THE FELONY LEAVING THE SECENE CHARGE, I ANSWERED ``NO`` ON QUESTION 22.  IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING AT THE TIME, THAT THE STATE OF FLORIDA DROPPED THE FELONY SO I ASSUMED THE ``CHARGE`` WOULD NOT BE ON MY RECORD.  UNTIL THE NASD INFORMED ME OF THE SITUATION, I HAD NO IDEA.  TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 5 MPH I STUCK A MAN, HE RUCK, A MAN, HE WAS UNHURT SO I LEFT.  NOTICING POLICE BEHIND, I RETURNED SO LEAVING SCENE CHARGE WAS DROPPED (FELONY).  NO DAMAGE TO VEHICLE OR PERSON OCCURED.""
