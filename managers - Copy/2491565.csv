  ""Broker Comment"" : ""SANTANDER BANK.  I HAD A 40 FOOT MOTORCOACH WITH A LOAN OF $154,085 AT 8% INTEREST.  I HAD PAID IT DOWN TO A BALANCE OWED OF $35,691 WHEN I LOST MY JOB AT WELLS FARGO.  I WENT FROM MAKING $500,000 A YEAR TO NOTHING AND COULDN'T AFFORD TO MAKE A PAYMENT.  I FOUND A BUYER THAT WOULD TAKE ME OUT EVEN, BUT SANTANDER REQUIRED THAT I PAID THE NOTE IN FULL BEFORE THEY WOULD RELEASE THE TITLE.  I COULD NOT RAISE THE MONEY TO DO THIS AND THE BUYER WALKED AWAY.  SANTANDER THEN REPOSSESSED THE COACH AND WROTE OFF THE BALANCE.""
