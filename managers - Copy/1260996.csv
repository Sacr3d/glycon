  ""Broker Comment"" : ""While working with this client at BancWest Investment Services we had created a thoughtful, future retirement income strategy. After I left BancWest Investment Services this client's accounts we're transferred to multiple BancWest Investment Services financial advisors. The BancWest Investment Services financial advisors that we're handling this client's accounts had overlooked, failed to implement, or we're unaware of the client's multiple investment liquidity features. 1.) The client's annuity #1 (which was put in place by a previous financial advisor at RBC Capital Markets) has been out of surrender for quite some time and is totally liquid. 2.) The client's annuity #2 has an annual 10% liquidity feature which the BancWest Investment Services financial advisors we're accessing incorrectly. 3) The client's annuity #3 has a guaranteed lifetime income rider which had not been implemented, in addition this product also has an available annual 10% liquidity feature that had been untapped by the BancWest Investment Services financial advisors. 5) The client's annuity #4 has a liquidity feature that allows a client to take a substantial lump sum one time distribution which then resets the monthly distribution amount. This feature was also untapped by the BancWest Investment Services financial advisors. 6) Both annuity # 2 and annuity # 3 have Assisted Living/ Nursing Home riders which creates complete access to assets within both investments if necessary. After I left BancWest Investment Services, the BancWest Investment Services financial advisors that we're handling this client's accounts had overlooked, failed to implement, or we're unaware of the client's multiple investment liquidity features.""
