  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC ADMIN RELEASE 34-74089/IA RELEASE 40-3999/INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT RELEASE 40-31421/ JANUARY 16, 2015: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE COMMISSION) DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED AGAINST EDGAR LEE GIOVANNETTI. AFTER AN INVESTIGATION, THE DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT ALLEGES THAT: FROM 1990 UNTIL HIS RESIGNATION ON DECEMBER 30, 2011, GIOVANNETTI EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED AN INVESTMENT ADVISER (IA) AS ITS CEO. AS THE CEO AND CHAIRMAN OF ITS PARENT ENTITY, GIOVANNETTI HELD THE SECOND LARGEST EQUITY INTEREST IN THE IA AND LATER ITS PARENT ENTITY. PRIOR TO, AND AFTER, APRIL 2009, THE IA AND GIOVANNETTI RECOMMENDED A NEW YORK-BASED THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENT ADVISER REGISTERED WITH THE COMMISSION (THE NEW YORK INVESTMENT ADVISER) AND ITS FUNDS TO SEVERAL OF THEIR CLIENTS. APPROXIMATELY SEVEN CLIENTS, INCLUDING TWO PUBLIC PENSION FUNDS, FOLLOWED THE IA'S AND GIOVANNETTI'S RECOMMENDATIONS BY INVESTING IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE NEW YORK INVESTMENT ADVISER'S FUNDS. ON JULY 29, 2009, ONE OF THOSE PUBLIC PENSION FUND CLIENTS MADE A FURTHER CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION INVESTMENT OF $10 MILLION INTO ONE OF THE FUNDS OF THE NEW YORK INVESTMENT ADVISER. IN OR ABOUT APRIL 2009, GIOVANNETTI WAS UNDERGOING SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. ON APRIL 21, 2009, GIOVANNETTI OBTAINED A PERSONAL LOAN OF $50,000 FROM THE NEW YORK INVESTMENT ADVISER AND EXECUTED A PROMISSORY NOTE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. GIOVANNETTI FAILED TO DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE LOAN TO THE IA'S COMPLIANCE GROUP IN VIOLATION OF THE IA'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. ON AUGUST 8, 2009, GIOVANNETTI SENT AN EMAIL TO THE IA'S CCO, FALSELY STATING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT HE HAD PAID OFF THE LOAN. GIOVANNETTI HAD NOT REPAID THE LOAN AND IT WAS STILL OUTSTANDING AS OF THE DATE OF THAT COMMUNICATION TO THE IA'S CCO. CONTRARY TO HIS STATEMENTS TO THE IA COMPLIANCE GROUP, GIOVANNETTI, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ACKNOWLEDGED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS TO THE NEW YORK INVESTMENT ADVISER THAT HE HAD NOT PAID BACK THE LOAN, AND HE FAILED TO ADVISE THE IA OR THE IA COMPLIANCE GROUP THAT THE LOAN HAD NOT BEEN PAID BACK. AS A RESULT OF HIS ACTIONS, NECESSARY INFORMATION WAS NOT DISCLOSED IN THE FIRM'S FORMS ADV PART II, OR IN A FORM ADV PART 2A. AS A RESULT, THOSE FORMS CONTAINED MATERIAL OMISSIONS WHEN FILED WITH THE COMMISSION. IN AUGUST 2011, IN CONNECTION WITH AN EXAMINATION OF THE IA CONDUCTED BY STAFF FROM THE COMMISSION'S NATIONAL EXAMINATION PROGRAM, GIOVANNETTI ADMITTED TO COMMISSION STAFF THAT THE DEBT OWED TO THE NEW YORK INVESTMENT ADVISER WAS STILL OUTSTANDING. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE IA DISCLOSED THE EXISTENCE OF THAT DEBT IN ITS FORM ADV PART 2A, DATED AUGUST 24, 2011, BUT DID NOT FULLY DISCLOSE THE STATUS OF GIOVANNETTI'S DEBT. BETWEEN AT LEAST SEPTEMBER 2011 AND OCTOBER 2011, GIOVANNETTI MADE MULTIPLE FALSE STATEMENTS TO THE IA COMPLIANCE GROUP CONCERNING THE LOAN, INCLUDING THAT HE HAD \""RETIRED THE LOAN\"" AND THAT HE HAD \""COMMUNICATED THIS TO THE SEC WHEN HE WAS INTERVIEWED DURING THE LAST EXAM.\"" THE IA REPEATED THE SAME INACCURATE AND INCOMPLETE DISCLOSURES THAT IT HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE IN ITS SUBSEQUENT FORM ADV PART 2A DATED MARCH 28, 2012. AS A RESULT, THIS FORM ADV PART 2A CONTAINED MATERIAL OMISSIONS WHEN FILED WITH THE COMMISSION. ON OR ABOUT JULY 20, 2012, GIOVANNETTI FINALLY REPAID THE LOAN AND INTEREST (TOTALING $63,044) TO THE NEW YORK INVESTMENT ADVISER. AS A RESULT OF THE CONDUCT, GIOVANNETTI WILLFULLY VIOLATED SECTIONS 206(1) AND 206(2) OF THE ADVISERS ACT, VIOLATED SECTION 207 OF THE ADVISERS ACT, AND WILLFULLY AIDED AND ABETTED AND CAUSED THE IA'S VIOLATION OF SECTION 207 OF THE ADVISERS ACT."",
