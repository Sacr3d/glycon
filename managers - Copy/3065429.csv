  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Blasczyk consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he made an unsuitable recommendation to his customer that she liquidate a variable annuity she had owned for ten years and made this recommendation based in part on a fundamental misunderstanding of the variable annuity's performance. The findings stated that accordingly, Blasczyk did not have a reasonable basis to believe that his recommendation was suitable for his customer. Blasczyk understated the annual rate of return for the variable annuity. Blasczyk also wrongly concluded that his customer's funds were at risk because the amount she held in the annuities was nearing the amount insured from loss by the Wisconsin Insurance Security Fund, when in reality they were well below that amount. As a result of Blasczyk's recommendation, his customer liquidated the variable annuity and forfeited a substantial guaranteed income benefit base that she had accumulated. Blasczyk did not earn a commission on the variable annuity liquidation, and the customer did not sustain any realized losses because of the liquidation."",
