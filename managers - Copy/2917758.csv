  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I MEET WITH [FAMILY MEMBER] (FATHER) AND SON TO DISCUSS [FAMILY MEMBER'S] B SHARE MUTUAL FUND ACCOUNT. [FAMILY MEMBER'S] WIFE, [CUSTOMER], WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE MEETING AS SHE WAS NOT ON THE ACCOUNT AT THE TIME. [FAMILY MEMBER] WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE FUNDS PERFORMANCE AND I INDICATED HE COULD TRANSFER WITHIN THE FUND FAMILY OR WAIT TILL MATURITY (WHICH WAS 6 YEARS OUT). I FURTHER EXPLAINED THAT EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CLOSE TO THE MATURITY DATE IN THE FUND THERE WAS A BACK END CHARGE IF HE LIQUATED BEFORE MATURITY WAS REACHED; I PROCEEDED TO PROVIDED THE EXACT FEE ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING THE B SHARE BEFORE MATURITY DATE. WITH ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED TO CLIENT HE STRESSED HE WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE FUND AND REQUESTED THE FUND BE SOLD THAT DAY.   NOTE: I WAS NOT PART OF THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS, NOR WAS I FOUND GUILTY OF ANY WRONG-DOING OR RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PORTION OF THE SETTLEMENT FEE.""
