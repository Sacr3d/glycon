  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In over 25 years as a licensed Financial Advisor, I have not had a single blemish to my industry record until this false and baseless claim. I wish for my record to reflect that I had absolutely unequivocally no culpability for this claim. I never spoke to the Claimant or had any knowledge of the Claimant's account transfer request since it was handled directly by the administrative office of TD Wealth Management. The Claimant only ascertained my name from his closing statement since I had just had been reassigned his account that same month from his previous advisor. Claimant has since admitted we never spoke or met and therefore has withdrawn his claim against me as evidenced by the withdraw letter sent to FINRA.""
