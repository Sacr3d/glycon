  ""Broker Comment"" : ""TWO YEARS AFTER LEAVING A COMPANY (MARCH 2007), I WAS INFORMED BY MY EX-EMPLOYER THAT HE WANTED ME ARRESTED FOR \""STEALING\"" SERVICES (DRY-CLEANING AND CAR TRANSPORTATION - AVAILABLE PERKS THAT I HAD USED DURING MY EMPLOYMENT). THE EX-EMPLOYER WAS VINDICTIVE BECAUSE I HAD LEFT THE FIRM FOR A BETTER OPPORTUNITY - HE STATED THAT I HAD OVERUSED THE PRIVILEGES. THIS IS UNTRUE, AS THE FIRM PROVIDED UNLIMITED ACCESS TO VARIOUS \""PERKS\"" IN LIEU OF CONSISTENT WAGES. WHEN HE THREATENED ME WITH ACTION, I SAID I WANTED NO FURTHER CONTACT FROM HIM AND ASKED WHAT AMOUNT HE BELIEVED I OWED HIM. I WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM - AS HE IS EXTREMELY PARANOID, UNETHICAL, AND AGGRESSIVE IN NATURE - AND WANTED TO CLOSE OUR RELATIONSHIP. HE SAID $400 AND I SENT HIM A CHECK TO COVER THE EXPENSES. HOWEVER, HE PROCEEDED TO CONTACT THE MIDTOWN POLICE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE ME ARRESTED FOR LARCENY. WHEN I SPOKE WITH THE DETECTIVE ON THE CASE, HE WAS EMPATHETIC AND FELT THE CHARGES TO BE GROSSLY UNFAIR AND UNJUST. THE CASE WAS DISMISSED BEFORE TRIAL AS THE DA DECLINED THE CASE.""
