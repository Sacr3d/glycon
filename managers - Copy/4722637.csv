  ""Allegations"" : ""CLIENT PURCHASED A CORPORATE BOND WITH A COUPON RATE OF 6.75%. ORIGINAL PURCHASE DATE WAS MAYBE IN DECEMBER 07, OR JANUARY. I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE CLIENT'S INFO. THE VALUE OF THE BOND HAD BEEN DECLINING OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND CLIENT WENT FROM 500,000 TO 468,000. HE WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE VALUE NEVER FLUCTUATED, AND HE STATES THAT HE WAS TOLD THAT HIS MONEY AND PRINCIPLE WAS GUARANTEED. CLIENT HAD BEEN EDUCATED ON THE VALUE OF BONDS, HOW THEY FLUCTUATE IN VALUE, AND HOW INTEREST WAS PAID. THE CLIENT CALLED THE CURRENT FINANCIAL ADVISOR AND HE WENT THROUGH THE SAME SCENARIO WITH THE CLIENT AND TOLD HIME THE SAME THINGS THAT WERE EXPLAINED TO HIM PROIR. THE CLIENT SEEMED SATISFIED AND INDICATED THAT HE MIGHT INVEST EVEN MORE."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""OUR RECORDS REFLECT THE 500,000 GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP 6.75% DUE 10/1/37 WAS PURCHASED ON 11/08/07 AT A DISCOUNT FOR THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $494.375. A TRADE CONFIRMATION WAS PROVIDED AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE REFLECTING THE PURCHASE INFORMATION. FA STATED HE REVIEWED THE FEATURES OF THE BOND AND EXPLAINED THE VALUE OF THE BOND WOULD FLUCTUATE; HOWEVER, THE INTEREST PAID ON THE BOND (6.75%) WOULD REMAIN THE SAME AND WOULD PAY ON THE FULL FACE VALUE (500,000) OF THE BOND. ACCORDING TO THE FA, HE DID EXPLAIN THE CLIENT COULD SELL THE INVESTMENT ON ANY BUSINESS DAY OF THE WEEK AND THE AMOUNT RECEIVED WOULD BE BASED ON THE CURRENT VALUE WHICH COULD BE UP OR DOWN. HE CLAIMS HE WAS CONTACTED ABOUT THE DECLINE IN VALUE AND HE AGAIN REVIEWED THE INVESTMENT AND HIS PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS REGARDING MARKET FLUCTUATION. AT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION, HE BELIEVED CLIENT WAS FINE WITH THE INVESTMENT AND CLIENT CONCERNS HAD BEEN ADDRESSED. FA STATED HE HAS NEVER GUARANTEED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BOND. BASED ON OUR REVIEW, IT DOES APPEAR THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INVESTMENT WAS MADE BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH FA AND WITH CLIENTS' AUTHORIZATION. FURTHER, IT APPEARS THE RISK OF MARKET FLUCTUATION WAS DISCUSSED AND NO GUARANTEES WERE MADE BY FA REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BOND. OUR RECORDS REFLECT THE BOND IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE STATED INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNT AND, WHILE THE VALUE OF THE BOND MAY CHANGE, THE INTEREST WILL CONTINUE TO PAY AT 6.75% ON THE FULL FACE VALUE OF THE BOND ($500.000). CLAIM DENIED.""
