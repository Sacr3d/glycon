  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Mr. Estes executed a letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent (AWC) with FINRA on July 29, 2016, which was accepted on August 16, 2016.  Mr. Estes reported the AWC to the NIPR Warehouse approximately 90 days later, on November 25, 2016.  Virginia and North Carolina insurance regulators noticed the failure of the AWC to be reported within 30 days, as required by their code.  To resolve the late filing issue with these regulators, Mr. Estes voluntarily surrendered his non-resident producer licenses in these states.  The Indiana insurance settlement stems from the failure of the AWC, and these follow-on matters, to be reported within 30 days, as required by the Indiana Insurance Code."",
