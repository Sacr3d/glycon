  ""Broker Comment"" : ""IN SEPT 08, THE RESERVE FUND ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE INDICATING SOME OF ITS FUNDS WOULD \""BREAK THE BUCK.\"" SUBSEQUENTLY, THE RESERVE FUND ISSUED INTENTIONS TO LIQUIDATE SOME FUNDS. THIS RESULTED IN SOME POSITIONS, INCLUDING RYPQX, UNAVAILABLE FOR IMMEDIATE REDEMPTION AWAITING THE RESERVE FUND'S LIQUIDATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS.  CUSTOMER INQUIRED ABOUT OTHER VEHICLES FOR HIS CASH IN THE SWEEP ACCOUNT. I PRESENTED HIM THE RESERVE FUND AS AN OPTION WHICH PAYS A HIGHER YIELD. I TOLD HIM THIS WOULD BE A \""POSITION\"" IN HIS ACCOUNT AND THERE WOULD BE A 1 DAY SETTLEMENT TO HAVE FUNDS LIQUID WHICH WAS DIFFERENT THAN THE MONEY MARKET SWEEP ACCOUNT HE CURRENTLY HAS HIS FUNDS IN WHICH IS FULLY LIQUID. I ALSO TOLD HIM THAT EVEN THOUGH THE FUND STRIVES TO MAINTAIN $1 PER SHARE THAT THIS IS NOT GUARANTEED NOR INSURED. HE ASKED ME HOW THE FUND CAN PAY A HIGHER YIELD THAN HIS MONEY MARKET. I TOLD HIM THIS FUND HAS SHORT TERM BONDS IN THE PORTFOLIO WHICH IS WHY IT IS NOT A MONEY MARKET. MONEY MARKET FUNDS HOLD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. THERE IS A DISCLOSURE THE CUSTOMER MUST SIGN ACKNOWLEDGING THIS IS NOT A MONEY MARKET FUND NOR A SWEEP VEHICLE. I REVIEWED THIS DISCLOSURE WITH [CUSTOMER]. HE CHOSE TO THINK ABOUT IT AT THAT TIME AND AT A LATER TIME DECIDED TO INVEST HIS FUNDS IN THE RESERVE ACCOUNT. HE WAS MAILED A PROSPECTUS BY THE RESERVE FUNDS WHICH HE BROUGHT IN TO ME AND WE REVIEWED AGAIN POINTING OUT THAT THIS IS NOT A MONEY MARKET FUND .  I NEVER AT ANY TIME TOLD HIM THIS WAS A MONEY MARKET NOR A MONEY MARKET ALTERNATIVE.I WAS NOT EMPLOYED AT THE FIRM AT TIME OF COMPLAINT""
