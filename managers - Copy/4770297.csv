  ""Judgment/Lien Amount"" : ""$6,000.00"",
  ""Judgment/Lien Type"" : ""Civil"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""This was a contract dispute between a homeowner [third party] and my father, a NC General Contractor regarding a home renovation project.  My father hired me as a part time laborer while I was between jobs. The homeowner added several things above and beyond the contract price which resulted in a dispute. Homeowner new I was only an employee only but still named me on suit as my father and I have same last name.  My father did not have the financial means to hire competent legal counsel to fight this to have me removed from suit.  I was an innocent bystander that shared the same last name as my father.  I never should have been included in this matter. My father has been working with homeowners attorney to pay this off. I have never been listed as an owner or interested party in my fathers business or LLC.  I adamantly deny all association to this matter.""
