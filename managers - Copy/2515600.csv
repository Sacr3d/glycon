I SENT A PROPOSAL TO THE CLIENT ALONG WITH  PROSPECTUS.  THE CLIENT CALLED ME AND SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO INVEST $1 MILLION SO HE COULD REACH THE BREAK POINT TO BUY AT NAV.  THIS INDICATED TO ME HE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE FEE SCHEDULE INCLUDING THE TWO YEAR HOLDING REQUIRED ON NAV PURCHASE LIMIT OR MORE, IN THE PROSPECTUS.  I RAN THE ORDER AS HE REQUESTED.  CLIENT SOLD FUND JANUARY 1998 THROUGH ANOTHER BROKER (NOT MYSELF) AT U.S. BANCORP AND INCURRED A PENALTY.""
