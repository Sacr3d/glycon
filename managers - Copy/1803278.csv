  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Lincoln consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he failed to reasonably supervise a registered representative who engaged in an outside business activity that was not disclosed to, or approved by, his employing member firm, and who obtained unauthorized customer loans to fund the undisclosed outside business activity. Despite being aware that the representative was engaged in an outside business activity that had not been disclosed to the firm, Lincoln, in his capacity as the representative's supervisor, did not take any steps to investigate, prevent, and/or report the representative's misconduct to the firm.  The findings stated that Lincoln made false statements to the firm concerning the representative under his supervision, and a loan that Lincoln provided to the registered representative that was related to a rental property that the representative was operating as a business. At the time Lincoln made these statements to the firm, he had concerns about the representative's compliance with firm policies and applicable FINRA rules, because Lincoln knew that the representative was engaged in an outside business activity that had not been disclosed to the firm, and knew that the representative had obtained unauthorized loans from firm customers."",
