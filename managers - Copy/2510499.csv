  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CASE AGAINST STONE & YOUNGBERG, WHICH WAS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE, WAS WITHOUT MERIT AND SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN FILED. THE CLAIMANT WAS A SOPHISTICATED INVESTOR WHO WAS FULLY INFORMED OF THE ATTENDANT RISKS OF INVESTING IN A HEDGE FUND. SHE REPRESENTED IN WRITING TO ME AND STONE & YOUNGBERG THAT (1) THE INVESTMENT, THOUGH SPECULATIVE AND RISKY, WAS SUITABLE FOR HER, (2) SHE COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE HER ENTIRE INVESTMENT, AND (3) THE ONE YEAR \""LOCK UP\"" PERIOD FOR THE INVESTMENT WAS ACCEPTABLE. THE CLAIMANTS' LOSSES IN THE HEDGE FUND WERE CAUSED BY THE SUBPRIME AND CREDIT CRISES AND NOT BY ANY WRONGDOING BY ME OR BY STONE & YOUNGBERG. STONE & YOUNGBERG MADE A BUSINESS DECISION TO SETTLE THIS CLAIM. I WAS NOT ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT, I DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS, AND I DID NOT SIGN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. NEITHER I NOR STONE & YOUNGBERG ENGAGED IN ANY WRONGDOING OR INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT, AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT HAD STONE & YOUNGBERG ALLOWED THE  CASE TO GO TO AN ARBITRATION HEARING, THEY WOULD HAVE PREVAILED.""
