  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 17369, FEBRUARY 21, 2002: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\""COMMISSION\"") FILED AN ACTION IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO CHARGING FRANK D. GRUTTADAURIA, FORMERLY THE BRANCH MANAGER FOR THE CLEVELAND OHIO OFFICE OF A GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM, WITH SECURITIES FRAUD.  THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT GRUTTADAURIA VIOLATED SECTION 17(A) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (\""SECURITIES ACT\""), SECTION 10(B) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (\""EXCHANGE ACT\""), AND RULE 10B-5.   THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS, WHILE HE WORKED AT TWO DIFFERENT BROKERAGE FIRMS, GRUTTADAURIA STOLE AT LEAST $40 MILLION IN THE COURSE OF DEFRAUDING MORE THAN 50 CLIENTS. THE COMMISSION ALSO ALLEGED THAT GRUTTADAURIA CONTROLLED TWO ENTITIES AND USED THEM TO MISAPPROPRIATE THE FUNDS FROM HIS CLIENTS.  THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT OVER A PERIOD OF MANY YEARS, GRUTTADAURIA FALSELY TOLD CUSTOMERS THAT HE HAD BOUGHT OR SOLD SECURITIES FOR THEIR ACCOUNTS, WHEN, IN FACT, HE HAD MISAPPROPRIATED THEIR FUNDS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES.  HE ALSO MATERIALLY MISREPRESENTED THE VALUE OF AND THE POSITIONS HELD IN CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS, OFTEN FALSELY TELLING CUSTOMERS THAT THEIR ACCOUNTS CONTAINED A WIDE VARIETY OF HOLDINGS WORTH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  IN SOME INSTANCES, GRUTTADAURIA INDUCED CUSTOMERS TO GIVE HIM FUNDS BY CLAIMING THAT HE HAD OPENED ACCOUNTS FOR THEM WHEN, IN FACT, NO ACCOUNT EVER EXISTED FOR THE CLIENT AND HE SIMPLY MISAPPROPRIATED THE FUNDS.   THE COMMISSION ALLEGED THAT GRUTTADAURIA MISAPPROPRIATED FUNDS FROM CUSTOMERS AND DIRECTED THE FUNDS TO OTHER CUSTOMERS EITHER AS PURPORTED RETURNS ON NON-EXISTENT INVESTMENTS OR TO SATISFY WITHDRAWAL REQUESTS FROM ACCOUNTS AS TO WHICH GRUTTADAURIA HAD DECEIVED THE ACCOUNT HOLDERS INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY HAD SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO MAKE TRANSFERS.  IN PARTICULAR, GRUTTADAURIA MISAPPROPRIATED OVER $25 MILLION IN CUSTOMER FUNDS BY FRAUDULENTLY DIRECTING THE MONEY INTO AN ACCOUNT THAT HE CONTROLLED, AND USING IT TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OTHER CUSTOMERS.  LATER, GRUTTADAURIA SIMILARLY MISAPPROPRIATED AND FUNNELED OVER $15 MILLION IN CUSTOMER FUNDS THROUGH A BANK ACCOUNT HE CONTROLLED IN THE NAME ANOTHER COMPANY.   THE COMMISSION FURTHER ALLEGED THAT, TO CONCEAL HIS FRAUD, GRUTTADAURIA CREATED AND SENT DEFRAUDED CUSTOMERS UNAUTHORIZED AND FALSIFIED ACCOUNT STATEMENTS THAT GREATLY OVERSTATED THE VALUE OF THE CUSTOMERS' ACCOUNTS, REFLECTED HOLDINGS THAT DID NOT EXIST AND SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS THAT HAD NEVER OCCURRED, AND FAILED TO DISCLOSE THE UNAUTHORIZED WITHDRAWALS FROM THE ACCOUNTS.  THE MOST RECENT FALSE ACCOUNT STATEMENTS FOR THE ACCOUNTS OF AT LEAST 50 OF GRUTTADAURIA'S CUSTOMERS REFLECTED AN AGGREGATE VALUE OF ABOUT $278 MILLION, WHEREAS THE ACTUAL VALUE OF ACCOUNTS HELD FOR THESE CUSTOMERS WAS ABOUT $1.8 MILLION.  WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OR AUTHORIZATION OF THESE CUSTOMERS, GRUTTADAURIA CAUSED THEIR ACTUAL BROKERAGE ACCOUNT STATEMENTS TO BE SENT TO ENTITIES OR POST OFFICE BOXES UNDER HIS CONTROL."",
