  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 22660, MARCH 26, 2013: ON MARCH 26, 2013, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION CHARGED A CALIFORNIA-BASED HEDGE FUND ANALYST WITH INSIDER TRADING IN ADVANCE OF A MERGER OF TWO TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES BASED ON NONPUBLIC INFORMATION HE RECEIVED FROM HIS FRIEND WHO WAS AN EXECUTIVE AT ONE OF THE COMPANIES.  THE SEC ALSO CHARGED THE EXECUTIVE AND ANOTHER TRADER IN THE $29 MILLION INSIDER TRADING SCHEME.  THE SEC ALLEGES THAT THE ANALYST OF SAN CLEMENTE, CALIF., WAS TIPPED IN ADVANCE OF A JULY 2008 ANNOUNCEMENT THAT A NETWORKING HARDWARE COMPANY HAD AGREED TO BE ACQUIRED BY A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY FOR APPROXIMATELY $3 BILLION. THE ANALYST'S SOURCE WAS THE NETWORKING COMPANY'S CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, A FRIEND WHO HE HAD PREVIOUSLY GIVEN INVESTMENT ADVICE. THE ANALYST THEN CAUSED THE SAN FRANCISCO-BASED HEDGE FUND ADVISORY FIRM WHERE HE WORKS TO BUY NETWORKING COMPANY SHARES IN LARGE QUANTITIES IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT, AND THE HEDGE FUNDS MANAGED BY THE FIRM REAPED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFITS WHEN THE NETWORKING COMPANY'S STOCK VALUE INCREASED UPON THE NEWS. THE ANALYST ALSO TIPPED A DENVER-BASED INVESTMENT PROFESSIONAL JOHN JOHNSON WHO HE BEFRIENDED THROUGH A PREVIOUS WORKING RELATIONSHIP, AND JOHNSON MADE ILLEGAL TRADES BASED ON THE NONPUBLIC INFORMATION. THE EXECUTIVE ALSO TIPPED THE ANALYST IN ADVANCE OF AT LEAST TWO OTHER MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE NETWORKING COMPANY, AND ANALYST'S FIRM TRADED ON THE NONPUBLIC INFORMATION TO MAKE PROFITS OR AVOID LOSSES.  IN A SEPARATE ACTION, THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ANNOUNCED CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST ALL THREE DEFENDANTS.  ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S COMPLAINT FILED IN FEDERAL COURT IN MANHATTAN, THE EXECUTIVE TIPPED THE ANALYST ON THE MORNING OF JULY 16 ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANY'S IMPENDING ACQUISITION OF THE NETWORKING COMPANY. THE ANALYST IMMEDIATELY SHARED THIS INFORMATION WITH COLLEAGUES AT HIS FIRM AS WELL AS JOHNSON AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHO PURCHASED NETWORKING COMPANY STOCK, OFTEN WITHIN MINUTES OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE ANALYST. NETWORKING COMPANY STOCK CLIMBED APPROXIMATELY 32 PERCENT AFTER THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE MERGER ON JULY 21.  THE SEC ALLEGES THAT THE EXECUTIVE, WHO LIVES IN SAN JOSE, CALIF., CONTINUED TO PROVIDE MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION TO THE ANALYST ABOUT KEY EVENTS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS OF THE NETWORKING COMPANY'S ACQUISITION BY THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, WHICH WAS NOT FULLY COMPLETED UNTIL DEC. 18, 2008. THE ANALYST'S FIRM CONTINUED TO PROFITABLY TRADE NETWORKING COMPANY SECURITIES BASED ON THIS INSIDE INFORMATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EXECUTIVE TIPPED THE ANALYST IN ADVANCE OF AN OCTOBER 24 ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE NETWORKING COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDER VOTE TO APPROVE THE ACQUISITION WOULD BE DELAYED \""GIVEN RECENT DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION.\"" EARLIER IN 2008, THE EXECUTIVE TIPPED THE ANALYST IN ADVANCE OF THE NETWORKING COMPANY'S APRIL 11 EARNINGS FORECAST SO THE ANALYST'S FIRM COULD PROFITABLY TRADE IN ADVANCE OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT.  THE SEC'S COMPLAINT CHARGES ALL THREE DEFENDANTS WITH VIOLATING SECTION 17(A) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND SECTION 10(B) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND RULE 10B-5. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS A FINAL JUDGMENT ORDERING THEM TO DISGORGE THEIR ILL-GOTTEN GAINS PLUS PREJUDGMENT INTEREST, ORDERING THEM TO PAY FINANCIAL PENALTIES, AND PERMANENTLY ENJOINING THEM FROM FUTURE VIOLATIONS OF THESE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. THE COMPLAINT ALSO SEEKS TO PERMANENTLY PROHIBIT THE EXECUTIVE FROM SERVING AS AN OFFICER OR DIRECTOR OF A PUBLIC COMPANY."",
