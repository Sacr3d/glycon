  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Four years after I left this firm, a former client complained about the firm. The client was my client for a short time prior to my leaving the firm. I have no knowledge what transpired between the client and firm for four years after my departure, however I was neither named in the complaint nor responsible to pay a cent of any award. Since I was not a party to the arbitration, I did not have representation or fully participate in the process. I still stand behind my recommendation to the client at that time, I believe any wrong doing that may have taken place occurred after my departure.""
