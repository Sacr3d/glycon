  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS COMPLAINT IS WITHOUT MERIT AND I DENY THE ALLEGATIONS.  CLIENTS SPEAK SPANISH AND HAD INQUIRED ABOUT OPTIONS FOR THEIR MONEY AND WERE INTRODUCED TO ME BY A BANKER.  THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR BI-LINGUAL ADULT SON.  A CONSERVATIVE BOND FUND INVESTMENT WAS RECOMMENDED.  ALL DISCLOSURES REGARDING INVESTMENT RISK AND PRODUCT FEATURES WERE REVIEWED, WHICH WERE IN LINE WITH THEIR STATED RISK TOLERANCE AND INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.  A BROCHURE AND PROSPECTUS WERE PROVIDED.  THE CLIENTS AND THEIR SON WERE WELL AWARE OF WHAT THEY WERE PURCHASING, AN INVESTMENT PRODUCT.  THE SON WAS INVOLVED IN THE DECISION, HOWEVER, WAS NOT ADDED TO THE ACCOUNT AS AN ACCOUNT OWNER.  AFTER 10 MONTHS, THE CLIENTS WERE NOT HAPPY WITH MARKET VOLATILITY.  THEY COMPLAINED THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY PURCHASED A CD AND DIDN'T EXPECT PRICE MOVEMENT.  AS STATED, THE SON WAS NOT LISTED AS AN ACCOUNT OWNER, ALTHOUGH HE WAS PART OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS.  SINCE HE WAS NOT LISTED AS AN ACCOUNT OWNER, THE FIRM DID NOT OBTAIN ANY STATEMENT OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM HIM REGARDING THIS TRANSACTION.  I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO HAVE THE CLIENTS' SON LISTED AS AN ACCOUNT OWNER, SINCE HE WAS PART OF THE INVESTMENT DECISION.""
