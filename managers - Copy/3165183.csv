  ""Allegations"" : ""SEC ADMINISTRATIVE RELEASE 34-63963, FEBRUARY 24, 2011: THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\""COMMISSION\"") DEEMS IT APPROPRIATE AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS BE, AND HEREBY ARE, INSTITUTED PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 15(B) AND 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (\""EXCHANGE ACT\"") AGAINST TONY AHN (\""AHN\"" OR \""RESPONDENT\"").  THESE PROCEEDINGS ARISE OUT OF THE MANIPULATION OF THE PRICES OF A NUMBER OF MICROCAP ISSUER STOCKS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 2007 (THE \""RELEVANT PERIOD\"") BY AHN, HIS FIRM AND OTHERS IN SERVICE OF A LARGER FRAUD PERPETRATED ON THE INVESTORS IN SEVERAL NOW DEFUNCT HEDGE FUNDS MANAGED BY A LONDON-BASED HEDGE FUND MANAGEMENT COMPANY THAT PURPORTED TO HAVE $2.1 BILLION IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AS OF AUGUST 31, 2007. THE CO-FOUNDER AND CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER ABRUPTLY RESIGNED FROM THE HEDGE FUND MANAGEMENT COMPANY ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2007. THE NEXT DAY, FUND MANAGEMENT COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT EIGHT HEDGE FUNDS IT MANAGED HELD BETWEEN $440 TO $530 MILLION IN \""ILLIQUID POSITIONS.\"" MOST OF THESE \""ILLIQUID POSITIONS\"" WERE, IN FACT, U.S.-MICROCAP STOCKS PURCHASED AND TRADED BY THE HEDGE FUNDS PRIMARILY THROUGH AHN'S FIRM.  AS THE FIRM'S PRIMARY TRADER, AHN, EXECUTED NUMEROUS TRADES THAT MANIPULATED UPWARDS THE PRICE OF THE MICROCAP STOCKS. AHN RECEIVED THE HEDGE FUNDS' TRADE ORDERS FROM ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL, WHO RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE CO-FOUNDER OF THE HEDGE FUND MANAGEMENT COMPANY.  AHN WOULD OFTEN COMMUNICATE WITH THE INDIVIDUAL VIA AN ONLINE INSTANT MESSAGING SYSTEM IN WHICH THEY OPENLY DISCUSSED TRADE ORDERS. THE INSTANT MESSAGES ALSO REVEAL ANOTHER PERSON'S KNOWLEDGE AND OVERSIGHT OF THE SCHEME. SOME OF THE METHODS AHN AND THE INDIVIDUALS USED TO ACCOMPLISH THE PRICE MANIPULATION INCLUDED MATCHED ORDERS BETWEEN THE VARIOUS HEDGE FUNDS, MARKING THE CLOSE IN SHARES OF SEVERAL OF THE MICROCAP COMPANIES, AND WASH TRADES BETWEEN ACCOUNTS HELD IN THE NAMES OF THE SAME INDIVIDUAL FUNDS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE EXECUTED AT THE END OF THE DAY, AND VERY OFTEN THE END OF THE MONTH, FOR THE APPARENT PURPOSE OF MARKING THE CLOSE TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE HEDGE FUNDS' NET ASSET VALUES (\""NAVS\""), THEREBY ENGAGING IN \""PORTFOLIO PUMPING,\"" OR MATERIALLY OVERSTATING THE HEDGE FUNDS' PERFORMANCE AND NAVS BEFORE THE END OF THE MONTH. AT TIMES, TRADES WERE BACK-DATED TO THE PREVIOUS MONTH-END, ALSO WITH THE APPARENT PURPOSE OF PORTFOLIO PUMPING. THE INDIVIDUALS MADE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THROUGH THESE MANIPULATIVE TRADES AS WELL AS TRANSACTION FEES PAID TO AHN'S FIRM."",
