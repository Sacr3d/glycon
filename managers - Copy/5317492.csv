  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Claimant did not name me as a party to this matter. All allegations are categorically false and hereby denied. This matter is a firm product / strategy issue and the loss complained of resulted from extraordinary market conditions NOT unsuitability or misrepresentation. Claimant was referred to the advisor group/ manager of the strategy based on claimant's needs, objectives and best interest. Claimant, a qualified investor, was afforded ample due diligence and treated fairly. I am comfortable that the account was handled properly, and the strategy, risk and how it operated within varying markets was explained both orally and in writing by myself and the advisor group/manager. The account was coded aggressive/speculative and claimant participated in the strategy for several years, at times taking profit from it. Claimant's aggregate portfolio suffered no loss of principal through time of closing the accounts. As always, I acted in the best interest of the client at all times.""
