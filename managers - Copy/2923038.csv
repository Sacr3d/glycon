  ""Broker Comment"" : ""The IRS originally had me owing over $100,000 due to denying deductions for my children, which they said didn't exist. We've now arrived at a number, which we agree on. I've agreed to pay $200/month plus any future tax refunds. All garnishments have ceased. They also said if this was some sort of issue for my job they would release the lien.""

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""On December 24, 2010 our daughter Isabella was born with a genetic defect known as Trisomy 18. She was hospitalized on numerous occasions for extended periods of time. We have 6 other children so there was a lot of lost work time, so this caused a sever financial hardship. Isabella passed away on June 25, 2013. During the time she was with us and since her passing I have been severely underemployed which has made our situation worse. Once I satisy the other smaller judgement I will pay this one off.""
