  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THIS UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT OCCURRED ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO WHILE I WAS CELEBRATING AT A COLLEGE GRADUATION PARTY WITH FRIENDS. AT THE END OF A LONG EVENING I LEFT TO RETURN TO MY FRIEND'S HOUSE TO GO TO SLEEP BUT, BEING IN AN UNFAMILIAR PART OF TOWN, MISTAKENLY ENTERED THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR AND WENT TO SLEEP ON A CHAIR IN THE LIVING ROOM. THE NEIGHBOR AWOKE THE NEXT MORNING, FOUND ME STILL SLEEPING, CALLED THE POLICE AND PRESSED CHARGES. THE JUDGE, SEEING THE INCIDENT FOR WHAT IT WAS, REPLACED THE ORIGINAL CHARGE WITH THE LESSER MISDEMEANOR CHARGE AND TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUICKLY I AGREED TO PLEA NO CONTEST.""
