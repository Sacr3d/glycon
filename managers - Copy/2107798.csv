WALKER ALSO FAILED TO ESTABLISH, MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE SUPERVISORY CONTROL PROCEDURES THAT WERE REASONABLY DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS AND REGULATIONS. A 2008 FINRA EXAMINATION OF WALKER'S MEMBER FIRM DISCLOSED DEFICIENCIES IN THE FIRM'S WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES AND THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH SUPERVISORY CONTROL PROCEDURES. WALKER KNEW OF THESE DEFICIENCIES, AND OF THE ABSENCE OF CONTROL PROCEDURES, SINCE AT LEAST AUGUST 2006. NEVERTHELESS, WALKER FAILED TO UPDATE AND AMEND THE FIRM'S PROCEDURES TO CORRECT THESE ISSUES. WALKER KNEW OF THESE ISSUES AT LEAST IMMEDIATELY AFTER A 2006 FINRA EXAMINATION OF THE FIRM. THE FIRM WAS ISSUED A LETTER OF CAUTION WHICH ADVISED OF SPECIFIC DEFICIENCIES IN THE FIRM'S WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES. THESE DEFICIENCIES INCLUDED THAT THE PROCEDURES FAILED TO ADDRESS: MAINTENANCE OF THE FIRM'S FORM BD; PROHIBITION OF COMMISSION PAYMENTS TO NON-REGISTERED ENTITIES; DESIGNATION OF AN APPROPRIATELY LICENSED PRINCIPAL FOR EACH OF THE MEMBER'S PRODUCT LINES; MAINTENANCE OF WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES AT EACH OFFICE OF SUPERVISORY JURISDICTION; INVESTIGATION INTO THE QUALIFICATIONS OF NEW HIRES; OBLIGATIONS OF THE FIRM WHEN HANDLING ACCOUNTS OF ASSOCIATED PERSONS EMPLOYED AT OTHER FINRA-REGULATED BROKER-DEALERS; TIMELY PROVIDING ACCOUNTS RECORDS TO CUSTOMERS; PROMPT NOTIFICATION TO REGULATORS OF DEFICIENCIES IN REQUIRED NET CAPITAL; AND PROHIBITION OF THE SALE OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES BEYOND THE PRIVATE OFFERING'S EXPIRATION DATES. THE LETTER OF CAUTION ALSO INDICATED THAT THE FIRM'S WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES WERE DEFICIENT WITH RESPECT TO REGULATION S-P, IN THAT THESE PROCEDURES FAILED TO INCLUDE POLICIES IN AREAS SUCH AS: THE DISPOSAL OF CONSUMER REPORT INFORMATION, AND SAFEGUARDING CUSTOMER INFORMATION. THE LETTER OF CAUTION, ALTHOUGH ISSUED ONLY TO THE FIRM, WAS DELIVERED TO WALKER IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER OF THE FIRM. THUS, WALKER HAD NOTICE OF THE DEFICIENCIES. WALKER FAILED TO UPDATE AND AMEND THE WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES TO CORRECT THE DEFICIENCIES THAT HAD BEEN OUTLINED IN THE LETTER OF CAUTION.
