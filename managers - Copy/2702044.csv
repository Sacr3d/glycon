  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I WAS NOTIFIED ON JANUARY 15, 2009 THAT A FORMER CLIENT FROM MY FORMER FIRM, WAMU INVESTMENTS HAS FILED A COMPLAINT.  \""CLIENT ALLEGES HE RECEIVED POOR ADVICE FROM THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE IN REGARD TO THE ANNUITY PURCHASED IN JULY 2007.\""  THE TRANSACTION IN QUESTION INVOLVES A 1035 EXCHANGE FROM A HARTFORD DIRECTOR VARIABLE ANNUITY TO A SUNAMERICA VARIABLE ANNUITY.  PRIOR TO ANY ANNUITY EXCHANGE, WAMU INVESTMENTS HAD A STRICT POLICY REQUIRING A CLIENT'S WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION ON A VARIABLE ANNUITY DISCLOSURE FORM (APPROXIMATELY 4-5 PAGES IN LENGTH)-DETAILING MORTALITY AND EXPENSE FEES, VARIABLE SUB-ACCOUNT COSTS, TOTAL COSTS INCLUDING ANY RIDERS, SURRENDER CHARGES, AND A SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON OF THE CURRENT ANNUITY VS. THE PROPOSED ANNUITY.  AGAIN, THIS FORM HAD TO BE INITIALED AND SIGNED BY THE CLIENT.  IN ADDITION, A WRITTEN RATIONALE FURTHER DOCUMENTING THE CLIENT'S SITUATION AND REASONS FOR AN EXCHANGE WAS SUBMITTED TO THE COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT FOR REVIEW.  I HAD WORKED WITH THE CLIENT AND HIS WIFE FOR ALMOST 4 YEARS PRIOR TO MY LEAVING WAMU INVESTMENTS, AND HAD GOTTEN TO KNOW THEM QUITE WELL.  AS I RECALL, THE CLIENTS' INVESTMENT GOALS WERE CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND INCOME; RISK TOLERANCE WAS MODERATE; INVESTMENT TIME HORIZON WAS 5-10 YEARS (OR PERHAPS LONGER); AND PAST INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE INCLUDED SUCH PRODUCTS AS MUTUAL FUNDS, STOCKS AND VARIABLE ANNUITIES.  I FEEL THAT I PROPERLY PROFILED THE CLIENT; RECOMMENDED A PRODUCT THAT WAS IN LINE WITH THE CLIENT'S GOALS, RISK TOLERANCE, AND TIME HORIZON; AND PROVIDED THE CLIENT WITH FULL AND FAIR DISCLOSURE.  THE FORMS AND DOCUMENTS AT WAMU INVESTMENTS WILL SUPPORT MY STATEMENTS. I WAS INFORMED THAT COMPLAINT WAS DENIED ON 2/19/09.""
