The findings stated that prior to Gutierrez joining his firm, he was the managing member of a mail service that provided customers domiciled outside the United States with a private mail box. Just prior to joining the firm, Gutierrez amended the Articles of Organization of the mail service to remove himself as a managing member. However, while he was employed with the firm, Gutierrez remained involved with the mail service, acted as the custodian of its bank account and was paid $25,000 in compensation."",
