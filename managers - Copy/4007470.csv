  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CLIENT HAS STATED THAT SHE REQUESTED TO CASH OUT AND HAVE THE FUNDS SENT TO HER ON HER IRA.  ON NOVEMBER 10, 2008, THE CLIENT CALLED EXPRESSING HER CONCERN WITH THE MARKET AND WE DISCUSSED CURRENT VOLATILITY AND DECIDED TO MAKE NO CHANGE TO HER PORTFOLIO AT THAT TIME.   SHE DECIDED TO STAY FULLY INVESTED.  ON NOVEMBER 21, 2008, WE DISCUSSED THE CONTINUED VOLATILITY AND SHE REQUESTED THAT HER INVESTMENTS BE LIQUIDATED & MOVED TO A MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT.  THE FUNDS WERE PLACED IN A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND AT THAT TIME.  I MADE 7 ATTEMPTS FROM JAN 09 - JULY 09 TO DISCUSS A STRATEGY OF MOVING THE FUNDS BACK INTO THE MARKET. ON AUGUST 31ST 2009, AFTER A DISCUSSION WITH THE CLIENT, I RECOMMENDED THAT SHE TRANSFER HER FUNDS TO A BANK CD BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE COMFORT OF BEING IN THE MARKET BUT WANTED A HIGHER YIELD.  THE CLIENT PHONED IN MAY 7, 2010 REQUESTING HER RMD, I SUGGESTED AGAIN THAT SHE TRANSFER HER FUNDS TO A BANK CD AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THAT MOVE.  I PHONED THE CLIENT ON JUNE 2ND, 2010 REQUESTING THAT SHE TRANSFER HER FUNDS TO HER BANK.  BASED ON A DETAILED AUDIT OF THE ACCOUNT, THE ONLY FUNDS DISTRIBUTED FROM THE IRA WAS HER RMD.""
