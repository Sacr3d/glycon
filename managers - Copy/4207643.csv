  ""Judgment/Lien Type"" : ""Civil"",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Child support was awarded in my divorce decree in Jackson County, Oregon, case #10-4579-D2.  The children are in Washington State, but Oregon recently took charge of collecting, as I filed a modification due to being unemployed.  The Judgment is ongoing until the children are 18 years of age.  The monthly obligation is ongoing, and is garnished from my paycheck every payday.  Monthly child support obligation was modified on 1-1-19, and reduced to $742 per month.""
