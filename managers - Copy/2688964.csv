  ""Allegations"" : ""Markus was named a respondent in a FINRA complaint alleging that he executed 11 transactions in a customer's account without first obtaining authorization. The complaint alleges that he entered a note in his member firm's client notes software that falsely stated that he had spoken to the customer about the 11 purchases and that the customer agreed to the purchases. In addition, when correcting the trades, Markus entered a note that falsely stated that he had understood this to be mandate. The complaint also alleges that Markus falsely represented to FINRA that he had time and price discretion in the customer's account, when he did not."",

  ""Regulator Statement"" : ""Hearing Panel decision rendered July 16, 2018. The sanctions were based on findings that Markus executed unauthorized mutual fund purchases in a customer's account. The findings stated that Markus misrepresented facts to his member firm on two occasions. First, Markus misrepresented in his firm's client notes software system that he had spoken to the customer, and the customer had authorized Markus's mutual fund purchases. Second, when reversing the mutual fund purchases in the customer's account, Markus misrepresented on trade correction forms that he understood he had a \""mandate\"" to enter the trades. By these actions, Markus was intentionally concealing his misconduct from the firm. Member firms rely on the accuracy of the information contained in their records to supervise their associated persons and protect their customers. By misrepresenting information in firm records, Markus interfered with the firm's ability to do both. An associated person's entering false information into firm records contravenes ethical business practices and hinders supervision and customer protection. The findings also stated that Markus falsely represented to FINRA, in response to a request for information, that the customer had granted him time and price discretion when, in fact, he had not.  The decision became final September 4, 2018.""
