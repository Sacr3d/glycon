  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I MET W/ [CUSTOMER] AT HIS REQUEST IN EARLY JULY '02. HE  HAD A PORTFOLIO OF APPROX 1.5 MIL AND SAID HE WANTED TO SELL SUFFICIENT ASSETS TO PAY OFF A 500,000 HOME EQUITY LOAN AND BECOME \""DEBT FREE\"". I RECOMMENDED SECURITIES TO SELL AND HE AGREED, AND THE SALES WERE EXECUTED. ON JULY 5, '02 I RESIGNED FROM AMSOUTH TO JOIN SUNTRUST.  IN LATE AUGUST, AMSOUTH NOTIFIED ME THAT [CUSTOMER] HAD FILED A COMPLAINT ALLEGING THAT HE HAD TOLD ME TO SELL ALL OF HIS SECURITIES.  THIS WAS NOT THE INSTRX THAT [CUSTOMER] GAVE ME. FURTHER, HE DID NOT QUESTION THE SALES WHEN HE REC'D CONFIRMATIONS FOR THE SALE OF SECURITIES IN JULY OR WHEN HE REC'D THE 500,000 PROCEEDS. AFTER TELLING AMSOUTH MY SIDE OF THE STORY, THEY CHOSE TO SETTLE WITHOUT FURTHER INPUT FROM ME.""
