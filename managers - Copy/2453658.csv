The meetings (customer) states we had in July 2012, January 2013 & July 2013 did not occur due to the fact I had resigned from INVEST/CCBI in December of 2011 to go to work for SunTrust Investment Services.  I have not met with or spoken to (customer) since 2011.  (Customer's) assertion that I did not explain how the investment return was determined on the Certificate of Deposit is also untrue. (Customer) was made fully aware of the potential outcomes of the investment in question and was given a prospectus for each investment discussed.""
