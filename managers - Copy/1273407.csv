  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE CLIENT HAD TWO ACCOUNTS WITH A BALANCED MIX OF INVESTMENTS. ONE OF THE ACCOUNTS CONTAINED THE MAJORITY OF THE INCOME PRODUCING INVESTMENTS. THE SECOND ACCOUNT, THE IRA, HELD A DIVERSIFIED GROUP OF 8-12 MUTUAL FINDS. THE IRA HAD AN EXPECTED TIME HORIZON OF 10-15 YEARS. THE CLIENT CONSISTENTLY AGREED WITH AN INVESTMENT STRATEGY THAT INCLUDED BOTH EQUITIES AND INCOME INVESTMENTS. THE TWO ACCOUNTS REFLECTED THE DESIRED STRATEGY. THE CLIENT'S UNHAPPINESS RESULTED FROM THE DELCLINE IN THE IRA ACCOUNT DURING THE RECENT BEAR MARKET. THE IRA INVESTMENTS WERE SUITABLE GIVEN THE LONG TERM INVESTMENT HORIZON FOR THE IRA ASSETS AND THE DESIRE TO HAVE A GROWTH COMPONENT IN THE PORTFOLIO.""
