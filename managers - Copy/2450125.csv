  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE IMMEDIATE ANNUITY WAS ISSUED ON JULY 17, 2009. DISCUSSIONS INCLUDED REVIEWING CLIENT'S FINANCIAL SITUATION, MONTHLY EXPENSES, OUTSIDE INVESTMENTS AND SAVINGS AS WELL AS OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME. CLIENT HAD A NEED FOR STEADY, GUARANTEED INCOME AND TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS MORE THAN ONE MONTH'S PAYMENT IF NEEDED FOR AN EMERGENCY. A SECOND MEETING OCCURRED IN WHICH THE IMMEDIATE ANNUITY WAS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. CLIENT WAS INFORMED THE IMMEDIATE ANNUITY WOULD PROVIDE A REGULAR MONTHLY INCOME. IN ADDITION, IT WOULD ALLOW CLIENT TO RECEIVE ADVANCED PAYMENTS UP TO ONE FULL YEAR IN THE EVENT FUNDS WERE NEEDED FOR AN EMERGENCY. CLIENT INITIATED ADVANCED PAYMENTS FROM THE ANNUITY ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION (FIRST OCCURRING IN SEPTEMBER 2009) AND THE ACCESS TO THE FUNDS WERE AGAIN REVIEWED WITH CLIENT DURING THOSE TIMES. CLIENT WAS ADVISED TO PLACE CONCERNS IN WRITING; HOWEVER, EDWARD JONES DID NOT RECEIVE CORRESPONDENCE UNTIL CLIENT'S OCTOBER 2012 LETTER. THE TERMS OF THE IMMEDIATE ANNUITY ARE SET BY GENWORTH LIFE INS. CLIENT WAS PROVIDED WITH THE CONTRACT AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THE CONTRACT DELIVERY RECEIPT WAS EXECUTED BY CLIENT ON JULY 27, 2009. THE ANNUITY CONTAINED A FREE-LOOK PROVISION; HOWEVER, RECORDS REFLECT CLIENT DID NOT EXERCISE THIS OPTION AFTER RECEIPT AND REVIEW OF THE CONTRACT. BASED ON OUR REVIEW, WE BELIEVE CLIENT WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE FEATURES OF THE IMMEDIATE ANNUITY WHICH INCLUDED MONTHLY PAYMENTS AND ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL FUNDS. CLAIM WAS DENIED.""
