  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Lamendola consented to the sanction and to the entry of findings that he made misrepresentations to a customer by fabricating letters that purported to come from an annuity company regarding the status of the customer's deposit, which, at the time of his fabricated letters, had not been corrected. The findings stated that Lamendola wrote in each letter that the incorrect deposit was re-deposited into the correct account and the transaction was not reportable to the Internal Revenue Service. Lamendola had mistakenly deposited the customer's IRA contributions into his variable annuity account rather than his fixed annuity account. After the customer verbally complained about the error, Lamendola attempted to have the deposits redirected to the proper account. The findings also stated that Lamendola paid $15,999.55 to the customer to settle his verbal complaint regarding the mistaken IRA deposits. However, Lamendola did not notify his member firm of the customer's complaint nor his payment of funds to the customer to resolve the complaint. The findings also included Lamendola altered the customer and his wife's complaint letter to remove references to his prior settlement away from the firm in order to conceal his prior settlement from the firm. Lamendola then sent the altered complaint letter to the firm's compliance department causing it to maintain inaccurate books and records."",
