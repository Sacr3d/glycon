  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Ile consented to the sanction and to the entry of findings that he mismarked order tickets as unsolicited when the transactions were, in fact, solicited, thereby causing his member firm's books and records to be inaccurate. The findings stated the Ile mismarked the order tickets because he believed that his firm would not have processed the transactions if they had been correctly marked as solicited. The findings also stated that Ile recommended over-the-counter (OTC) equity securities to customers without reviewing the current financial statements of the issuers to determine whether there was a reasonable basis for making such recommendations. The findings also included that Ile exercised discretion in customers' accounts without obtaining prior written authorization from the customers and without his firm having accepted the accounts for discretionary trading."",
