  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I AM A LIFE INSURANCE AGENT & A REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE.  I'VE MAINTAINED SEVERAL BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS. ONE OF THESE, WITH W.I.G. SECURITIES, WAS A COMPLETELY DISCRETIONARY ACCOUNT.  INADVERTANTLY, I NEVER REPORTED ITS EXISTENCE TO MY BROKER-DEALER.  FOR A 2.5 YEAR PERIOD OVER 500 TRADES WERE MADE, FEWER THAN 10 OF WHICH INVOLVED IPO'S.  I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS A VIOLATION, LET ALONE THAT THESE TRADES WERE DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHERS THAT WERE MADE.  I REALIZE I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THESE RULES, BUT THE VIOLATION WAS UNINTENTIONAL. TO AVOID THE EXPENSE OF FURTHER LITIGATION, I AGREED TO THE ABOVE SETTLEMENT.""
