  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MY WIFE AND I FILED BANKRUPTCY ON MAY 31, 2011 AFTER A VERY LENGTHY PERIOD OF CONSIDERATION AND DISCERNMENT.   OUR PERSONAL DEBTS ARE A COMBINATION OF DEBTS INCURRED BEFORE MY WIFE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A LIFE-THREATENING DISEASE, AS WELL AS THE DEBT THAT ACCUMULATED DURING THE THREE YEARS THAT SHE WAS IN TREATMENT FOR HER CONDITION.  THIS INCLUDED TWO [REDACTED] SURGERIES, TWO YEARS APART, THAT RESULTED IN LENGTHY HOSPITAL STAYS; THE LAST THREE HOSPITAL STAYS WERE IN MARCH, APRIL AND MAY OF 2010 FOLLOWED BY NURSING CARE AT HOME FOR 2 MORE MONTHS.  THE TIME OUT OF WORK FOR BOTH OF US, COMBINED WITH OUR EXISTING DEBT AND EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LEFT US WITH NO ALTERNATIVES TO RESOLVE OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE LIABILITIES.""
