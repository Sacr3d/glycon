  ""Broker Comment"" : ""See Attached Letter: This Letter is in regards to a citation (06521 SMSM010329) I was issued on Oct 14, 1995.  On the night of October 14, 1995 I was leaving a bar in Iowa City IA.  A police officer saw that I has an open bottle of beer.  Looking to give the officer my identification he saw my fake ID and requested it. The officer then proceeded to call the information in on the ID. After not receiving any information back he requested my social security number which I provided. After my information was retrieved I was issued three citations. The first was Possession of Alcohol.  The second was False Information to a Law Enforcement Authority. The third was for a Fictitious ID.  For all I was issued a fine of $90 and paid them promptly.  My goal in writing this is to be up front and open about something that happened while I was in college over 20 years ago.  I've learned from my mistakes in the past and have not repeated them.  I hope that you will consider and approve my appointment.""
