  ""Broker Comment"" : ""Approximately 14 years after investing into an approved hedge fund that I started in 2002, my firm was named in an arbitration based on the primary fact that the hedge declined in value in 2008-2009, during the worst financial crisis in 70 years.  The highly accredited client was pursued to initiate the claim only against the firm to avoid the risk of being contractually being liable for all legal fees.  After providing close to 30,000 pages of documents, going back 14 years and responding to countless legal motions and frivolous charges, I made a business decision to settle the case, without admitting any guilt.  My individual contribution to the settlement was zero dollars.""

The client, who remained a client throughout, was pursued to initiate the claim with the understanding that the claim did not involve me.
