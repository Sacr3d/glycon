THE RESEARCH REPORTS FAILED TO DISCLOSE THAT THE RESEARCH ANALYST HAD A FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY IN VIOLATION OF 2711(H)(1)(A), AND FAILED TO DISCLOSE THE RESEARCH ANALYST'S ACTUAL, MATERIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST AS A RESULT OF HAVING ACCEPTED THE JOB WITH THE COMPANY, IN VIOLATION OF RULE 2711(H)(1)(C).  IN ADDITION, VAN DORSTEN ALSO VIOLATED 2210(D)(1)(A) BY FAILING TO DISCLOSE THE RESEARCH ANALYST'S ACCEPTANCE OF A JOB WITH THE COMPANY IN THE RESEARCH REPORT. THE FAILURE OF THE RESEARCH REPORT TO DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION WAS A MATERIAL OMISSION THAT RENDERED THE REPORT MISLEADING. VAN DORSTEN AND OTHERS IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT AT HIS MEMBER FIRM KNEW THAT THE RESEARCH ANALYST HAD ACCEPTED THE POSITION WHEN HE APPROVED THE REPORT. IN FACT, VAN DORSTEN TOLD THE RESEARCH ANALYST THAT SHE SHOULD CONTINUE TO COVER THE COMPANY AFTER SHE ACCEPTED THE JOB OFFER."",
