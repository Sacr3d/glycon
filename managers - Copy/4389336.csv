  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE EVENT TOOK PLACE IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA IN THE SPRING OF 1981. A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AT THE TIME, I WAS OUT ON THE TOWN WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS THE NIGHT BEFORE OUR FINAL SPRING BREAK TRIP TO THE BEACH. AS PART OF A JUVENILE GAME, WE CONCOCTED A RIDICULOUS TYPE OF SCAVENGER HUNT IN WHICH EACH OF US WAS TO OBTAIN A SMALL ARTICLE THAT PERTAINED TO THE BEACH.  THE ITEM I WAS ASSIGNED TO OBTAIN WAS A BOTTLE OF SUN TAN LOTION. WHILE MY FRIENDS WAITED IN THE CAR, I WENT INTO A LOCAL STORE AND ATTEMPTED TO STEAL A $2.49 BOTTLE OF LOTION BY CONCEALING IT IN MY SHORTS. UPON DOING SO, I WAS IMMEDIATELY DETAINED BY A SECURITY GUARD WHO HAD OBSERVED THE ENTIRE SCENE.  A POLICE OFFICER WAS CALLED. I WAS ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO THE POLICE STATION WHERE I WAS FINGER PRINTED AND CHARGED. MY PARENTS WERE BOTH NOTIFIED. I WAS RELEASED BUT ORDERED TO APPEAR IN COURT AT A LATER DATE. WE RETAINED AN ATTORNEY TO REPRESENT ME IN COURT.  THE OFFICIAL CHARGE ENTERED BY THE PROSECUTOR WAS FOR TRESPASSING. I ASSUME THIS WAS DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE INCIDENT. I ENTERED A PLEA OF GUILTY. NO TYPE OF PENALTY, SENTENCE, FINE OR COMMUNITY SERVICE WAS ADMINISTERED.   ""
