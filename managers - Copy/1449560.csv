  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Rollins consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he borrowed $70,000 from an 89-year-old customer of his for a five-year term with an agreed amount of interest. The findings stated that Rollins' member firm's written policies prohibited registered representatives from borrowing money from firm customers without any exceptions. Rollins did not document the loan or its terms in any written instrument. Rollins made monthly interest payments until stopping upon learning that the customer had died. Later, a representative of the deceased customer complained to the firm after she discovered evidence of the loan in the deceased customer's papers. The firm then repaid and settled with the customer's estate. The findings also stated that Rollins falsely answered, \""no,\"" in three firm annual compliance questionnaires in which he was asked if he \""solicited or accepted a loan from ... a client for any reason.\"""",
