She completed questionnaires about her objectives and risk tolerance and her funds were invested accordingly.  No misrepresentations were made to her.  She received full contemporaneous disclosure of all transactions.  The claim was settled and did not result in any finding of rule violation by FINRA.  I made only a small contribution to resolve this claim.""
