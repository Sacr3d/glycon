  ""Allegations"" : ""Alleged-- failed to provide fiduciary standards.  2014-2015. Trustee got into dispute with trust beneficiary.  I was hired by trustee to provide variety of services related to management of investment assets, real property, bill payment, and more.  The real dispute was between the trustee and the beneficiary of the trust. Four parties were part of the dispute. My E&O firm wanted to settle as it was cheaper than fighting the meritless complaint."",

  ""Broker Comment"" : ""$36K in case was paid by E&O.  They just had the opinion settling was cheaper than litigation.  Opposing attorneys were taking advantage of a 89 year old woman (the beneficiary of the trust) who had already been diagnosed with [REDACTED]. They are sick terrible people taking advantage of an elderly woman, and damaging a family.  The  insurance provided attorney and trustee attorneys had a very difficult time dealing with the trust beneficiary's attorneys, they were exceedingly difficult to work with, and fought or disputed nearly every email, contact, document and fact. They lost many documents over and over, and then accused us of not providing them.  I did NOTHING wrong on the case, and neither did the trustee.  We provided, on a very timely basis every account statement, check copy,  every tax document, every tax return provided written explanations of every expenditure, deposit, provided written explanations of investment account activity, and much more and their complaint stated we had not provided a complete accounting.  Frankly, if the trustee had not hired a terrible attorney, she would have likely won the case and all issues with me would have been dropped.  This entire case was the abuse of an elderly, ill lady, the abuse of a loving, honest, hard working trustee, and taking the advantage of the 'deep pockets' of my E&O carrier.""
