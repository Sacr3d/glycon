  ""Broker Comment"" : ""THE FIRST MEETING WITH THE [CUSTOMER] TOOK PLACE IN OCTOBER 2000 PRIOR TO THE STOCK MARKET CORRECTION.  DURING THE MEETING IT WAS DISCUSSED WHAT THE [CUSTOMER] SHORT AND LONG TERM OBJECTIVES WERE. [CUSTOMER], BEING A NTAP EMPLOYEE, WAS ADAMANT THAT THEIR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT GOAL WAS TO HOLD ONTO THE NTAP STOCK OPTIONS AND GET AS MUCH UPSIDE AS POSSIBLE.  THE [CUSTOMER]MADE IT CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING IN THEIR OWN HANDWRITING THAT THEY WERE \""WILLING TO TAKE BIG RISKS NOW.\""  THEIR LONG TERM GOAL WAS TO EVENTUALLY DIVERSIFY AND MAINTAIN WEALTH.  BASED ON THE CLIENT'S CONCENTRATED NTAP POSITION, A RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE TO DIVERSIFY THEIR PORTFOLIO.  THE [CUSTOMERS] REJECTED THE RECOMMENDATION TO SELL THE STOCK. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS THE [CUSTOMERS] BECAME CONCERNED AS THEY WATCHED THE STOCK CONTINUE TO DECLINE.  THE CLIENT FINALLY SOLD STOCK (2001) AT A PRICE FAR BELOW THE AMOUNT WHEN THE FIRST MEETING TOOK PLACE.  THE COMPLAINT FILED, COMPLETELY CONTRADICTS THE HANDWRITTEN NOTES OF THE [CUSTOMER].  THE CASE WAS SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION BUT SETTLED FOR AN AMOUNT FAR LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL COMPENSATORY DAMAGE AMOUNT.""
