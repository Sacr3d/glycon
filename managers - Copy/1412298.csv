  ""Broker Comment"" : ""**UPDATE - THIS DISCLOSURE IS NO LONGER REPORTABLE ON THE CURRENT U4 BECAUSE IT WAS FILED MORE THAN 24 MONTHS AGO AND DID NOT SETTLE FOR $15,000 OR MORE**Person's complaint, concerns and allegations have continued to change in an effort to gain monetary reimbursement for short term market fluctuation for investments that were discussed at length, that were agreed upon and supposed to be long term in nature, requiring commitment, monitoring and patience. It is disappointing that a new client so quickly and easily gives up on a long term investment plan that they agreed upon, and mark a clean and excellent twenty-nine plus year record.""
