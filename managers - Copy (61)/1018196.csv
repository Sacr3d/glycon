  ""Broker Comment"" : ""MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE NASD ARBITRATORS AWARDED [CUSTOMER] $132,982.50, WHICH SHEARSON PAID. I DISAGREE WITH THE U-5 FILED BY SHEARSON AND DEMANDED IT BE REVISED. [CUSTOMER'S] CHARGES AGAINST ME WERE ALL RELATED TO INFORMATION THAT I ACCURATELY RELAYED TO HIM FROM SHEARSON'S [CUSTOMER] TRADING DESK.  THERE WAS NO WRONGDOING ON MY PART AND NONE OF MY ACTIONS WERE EVER FOUND TO HAVE BEEN IMPROPER. SHEARSON'S REPORT THAT THE COMPLAINT WAS \""SETTLED OR DECIDED\"" AGAINST ME IS INACCURATE AND UNFAIR.  SHEARSON HAS NOT YET RESPONDED TO MY REQUEST FOR A CLEAN U-5.""
