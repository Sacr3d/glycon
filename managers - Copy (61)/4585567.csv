  ""Broker Comment"" : ""In 2009, My annual compensation was reduced following a layoff from HJ Sims and then a subsequent rehire 3 months later.  As a result of these adjustments, at the beginning of 2011, we made the decision to short sale our personal residence as a means to reduce expenses.  Bank of America agreed to the price to sell our home and we were fully released from the debt following a settlement payment.""
