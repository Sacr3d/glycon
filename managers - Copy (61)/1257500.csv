  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I have been named as one of twelve defendants in a civil suit. The plaintiffs have charged all defendants with assisting or having willful indifference, to a fraudulent scheme orchestrated by one individual, through his company (Company A). This individual was also the CEO of a separate, non-related company (Company B) whom I was contracted with to build a financial services firm. Due to my involvement with the separate company (Company B), the plaintiffs are seeking money from me. I was never employed or contracted by Company A, all parties acknowledge that there has been no allegation or evidence in this Civil Action that I was involved in or aware of the fraud perpetuated upon them.  At the advice of counsel, my decision to settle was purely a financial decision to mitigate my legal expenses.""
