  ""Broker Comment"" : ""A SINGLE ARBITRATOR RULED THAT JEROME G GERUM WAS AN UNSOPHISTICATED INVESTOR WHO HAD LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MARKET AND TOTALLY RELIED ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF HIS BROKER, MR KRAUSE. THE ARBITRATOR FURTHER FOUNT THAT GERUM DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH UNRATED BONDS. THE ARBITRATOR GRANTED AN AWARD OF 418,238.50 PLUS INTEREST AT THE WISCONSIN STATUTORY RATE. THE ARBITRATOR FOUND THAT MR ZIEGLAR WROTE A LETTER TO ALL BONDHOLDERS FOLLOWING THE BOND DEFAULT, TO THE EFFECT THAT ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT ASSURE A FAVORABLE OUTCOME TO THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOND TRUSTEE, B C ZIEGLER AND COMPANY WOULD ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE SOLUTION AT THE EARLIEST DATE. THE ARBITRATOR FURTHER FOUND THAT GERUM HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT PETER ZIEGLER, AS PRESIDENT OF B C ZIEGLER AND COMPANY, WAS A RESPONSIBLE PARTY IN OFFERING THE BONDS FOR SALE. JEROME G GERUM HAD BEEN A CLIENT FO B C ZIEGLER AND COMPANY SINCE 1974. JEROME G GERUM HAD AN INVESTMENT HISTORY OF PURCHASING NON-RATED NEW ISSURE BOND OFFERINGS. GERUM RECEIVED A PROSPECTUS AT TIME OF OFFERING, AND MR PETER KRAUSE, THE B C ZIEGLAR AND COMPANY INVESTMENT BROKER MADE NO RECOMMENDATION REGARDING PURCHASE SIZE. THE AWARD IS CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE OF 427,000, AND THE AMOUNT OF LIQUIDATION PROCEEDS RECEIVED BY THE CLAIMANTS. MR ZIEGLAR WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF THE SECURITIES AND WAS NAMED IN THE COMPLAINT SOLELY BECAUSE OF HIS POSITION AS PRESIDENT OF B C ZIEGLAR AND COMPANY.""
