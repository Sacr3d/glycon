JOSE FERNANDEZ, COMPLIANCE OFFICER OF FIRST EQUITY CORP. OF FLORIDA, AND WAS INFORMED THAT FIRST EQUITY HAD, IN 1979, FILED AN APPLICATION FOR MR. AGUERO TO TAKE A SERIES 7 EXMINATION WITH THE NASD AND THE STATE OF FLORIDA. WHEN MR. AGUERO DID NOT, THE STATE OF FLORIDA CANCELLED THE APPLICATION WHICH HAD BEEN SUBMITTED.  MR.
