  ""Allegations"" : ""Without admitting or denying the findings, Murphy consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that he exercised discretion in 48 customer accounts that were unrelated, non-discretionary accounts. The findings stated that Murphy did not obtain written authorization from any of the 48 customers to exercise discretion in their accounts and his member firm did not approve these accounts for discretionary trading. Murphy's exercise of discretion in his customers' accounts violated the firm's policies and procedures. Murphy executed transactions in the accounts pursuant to verbal authority from the clients but the transactions did not occur on the same days that the clients authorized those transactions. Murphy did not have the required prior written authorization from the customers or prior written approval from his firm to exercise discretion in the accounts. Also, Murphy made 11 mutual fund transactions for one of these customers after a short telephonic discussion with that customer. In that discussion neither the specific mutual funds nor the specific amounts that would be invested were expressly identified, and Murphy used his discretion to make those transactions."",
