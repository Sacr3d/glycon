  ""Broker Comment"" : ""GEORGE F. VALLE IS THE VICTIM OF MORTGAGE FRAUD. PLEASE SEE HIS FILE AT VENECREDIT SECURITIES FOR SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS OF HIS LEGAL FILING AGAINST THE TITLE INSURANCE UNDERWRITER AND THE FINAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT OF FORECLOSURE ENTERED IN BY THE COURT AGAINST GEORGE F. VALLE.   THE FRAUD OCCURRED BECAUSE BETWEEN 01/2003 THROUGH 03/2004 THREE PROPERTIES WERE SOLD TO GEORGE F. VALLE WITH DEFECTIVE TITLE. THE TRUE PROPERTY OWNERS' NEVER KNEW THAT THEIR PROPERTIES WERE BEING SOLD. AT THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHERE THE SALES TOOK PLACE SOMEONE IMPERSONATED THE TRUE OWNERS AND FORGED THEIR SIGNATURES ON THE DEEDS THAT TRANSFERRED TITLE TO GEORGE F. VALLE. IT WAS NOT UNTIL JUNE 2005 THAT THIS FRAUD WAS DISCOVERED WHEN THE TRUE OWNERS CAME FORWARD TO CLAIM THEIR PROPERTIES.    THIS FRAUD WAS PERPETRATED BY A MAN NAMED [THIRD PARTY] WHO INTRODUCED THE PROPERTIES FOR GEORGE F. VALLE TO PURCHASE.  IN ADDITION, [SPOUSE], WIFE OF [THIRD PARTY], WAS THE MORTGAGE BROKER. SHE FORGED MR. VALLE'S SIGNATURE AND LIED ON THE LOAN APPLICATIONS TO GET MR. VALLE'S LOANS APPROVED.  THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS IMPERSONATED THE TRUE OWNERS OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTIES DURING THE CLOSING SALE. OTHERS WHO WERE NEGLIGENT OR COMPLICIT IN THIS CRIME INCLUDE THE LENDERS WHO DID NOT VERIFY MR. VALLE'S INCOME OR EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION AND TITLE INSURANCE UNDERWRITER, ATTORNEY'S TITLE INSURANCE FUND (ATIF) AGENTS WHO FAILED TO TRANSFER GOOD TITLE OF THE PROPERTIES TO GEORGE F. VALLE. IF GOOD TITLE WOULD HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED THEN THE THREE SUBJECT PROPERTIES COULD HAVE BEEN SOLD AT A PROFIT.  ATTORNEY'S TITLE INSURANCE IS AVOIDING ITS OBLIGATION TO PAY THE CLAIM FOR ALLOWING DEFECTIVE TITLE TO TRANSFER TO GEORGE F. VALLE. IN THE MEANWHILE THE LENDERS ARE SUING MR. VALLE FOR THE LOAN AMOUNTS DUE. ON APRIL 23, 2007 A JUDGMENT WAS ENTERED AGAINST MR. VALLE BY HSBC TO FORECLOSE ON THE FIRST PROPERTY. ON AUGUST 20, 2009 ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFF ATTORNEY'S TITLE INSURANCE FUND, THE 11TH CIRCUIT COURT ISSUED A FINAL JUDGMENT AGAINST THIRD PARTY GERALD GAILES, YVETTE GAILES AND MISSION MORTGAGE FOR PARTICIPATING IN A REAL ESTATE/MORTGAGE FRAUD SCHEME, AND KNOWINGLY SUBMITTING FRAUDULENT AND FALSIFIED DOCUMENTS TO LENDERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES IN ORDER TO CONSUMMATE REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS.
