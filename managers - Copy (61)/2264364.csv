  ""Firm Name"" : ""CENTAURUS FINANCIAL, INC."",
  ""Termination Type"" : ""Discharged"",
  ""Allegations"" : ""THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE WAS TERMINATED FOR VIOLATIONS OF SECURITIES INDUSTRY RULES AND FIRM POLICES AND PROCEDURES WITH RESPECT TO RECEIVING CASH FROM A CUSTOMER FOR PAYMENT OF A SECURITIES TRANSACTION. THE RECEIPT AND HANDLING OF SAID CASH PAYMENT AND THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE'S FACILITATION OF THE PAYMENT VIOLATED MULTIPLE RULES."",
  ""Broker Comment"" : ""I DENY THE ALLEGATIONS MADE BY CENTAURUS. THE FACTS ARE THAT I VISITED WITH MY CLIENT DR. DAVID KANE IN BEND, OR TO REVIEW HIS INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL AFFAIRS. DR. KANE ASKED ME TO TAKE CASH BACK TO MIAMI TO GIVE TO HIS FATHER TO REPAY A DEBT HE OWED HIS FATHER. UPON MY RETURN TO MIAMI I CONTACTED MY FRIEND OF 20 YEARS MR. MURRAY KANE, DAVID'S FATHER, WHO CONTACTED HIS SON AND TOLD HIM HE DID NOT WANT THE MONEY BUT WOULD RATHER HE USE THE MONEY FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT. THE SON DECIDED TO USE SOME OF THE MONEY FOR INSURANCE POLICY AND THE REMAINDER TO BE INVESTED IN AN ANNUITY WITH ALLIANZ. SINCE IT WAS CASH, I WENT TO MY BANK AND INSTRUCTED THEM TO WIRE THE FUNDS TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND TO ALLIANZ. THE BANK, RATHER THAN DEPOSITING THE MONEY IN THE BANK'S ACCOUNT TO WIRE, MISTAKENLY PUT IT IN MY ACCOUNT AND THEN WIRED IT OUT IMMEDIATELY. THE DECISION TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS WAS NOT MADE UNTIL THE FATHER SPOKE WITH HIS SON. BOTH THE FATHER AND THE SON HAVE WRITTEN LETTES PLAINLY STATING THE FACTS REGARDING THIS MATTER AND STATING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS WERE CARRIED OUT EXACTLY AS THEY TOLD ME. THEY VERY PLAINLY STATE THEY HAVE NO COMPLAINTS OF ANY KIND REGARDING MY ACTIONS. THE BANK STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT SHOWS THE MONEY BEING DEPOSITED AND THE WIRE BEING SENT THE SAME DAY.""
