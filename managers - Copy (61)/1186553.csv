THE AWARD WAS PAID WITHIN 45 DAYS BY PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES.  NO FINES, PENALTIES OR SUSPENSIONS WERE LEVIED.  PLEASE NOTE THAT PRU EXPECTS TO SELL LP INTERESTS REPURCHASED FOR APPROX. $90M, THUS REDUCING THE NET COST OF THE AWARD TO APPROX. $145M. THE CLAIMANT'S ACCOUNT WAS OPENED IN 7/85 AS AN IRA ROLLOVER AND $300M IN LP INTERESTS WERE PURCHASED.  IN 1/86 PRU WAS INFORMED THE ACCOUNT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PROFITS SHARING PLAN ACCOUNT FBO-[CUSTOMER], MD. AT THAT TIME, PRU SUBMITTED TO THE TRUSTEE A TRUSTEE CERTIFICATION OF INVESTMENT POWERS FORM WHICH OMITTED THE LP CATEGORY.  CONSEQUENTLY, AS A RESULT OF THAT OMISSION, THE ARBITRATION PANEL AWARDED TO THE CLAIMANT THE REPURCHASE OF $190M IN LP INTERESTS BROUGHT BY THE PLAN AFTER 1/1/86. WERE IT NOT FOR THAT OMISSION, WE BELIEVE NO AWARD WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE.""
